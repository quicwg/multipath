1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an extension to QUIC version 1
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT] to enable the simultaneous usage of multiple paths
   for a single connection.

   This proposal is based on several basic design points:

   *  Re-use as much as possible mechanisms of QUIC version 1.  In
      particular, this proposal uses path validation as specified for
      QUIC version 1 and aims to re-use as much as possible of QUIC's
      connection migration.

   *  Use the same packet header formats as QUIC version 1 to minimize
      the difference between multipath and non-multipath traffic being
      exposed on wire.

   *  Congestion Control must be per-path (following [QUIC-TRANSPORT])
      which usually also requires per-path RTT measurements

   *  PMTU discovery should be performed per-path

   *  The use of this multipath extension requires the use of non-zero
      length connection IDs in both directions.

   *  A path is determined by the 4-tuple of source and destination IP
      address as well as source and destination port.  Therefore, there
      can be at most one active paths/connection ID per 4-tuple.

   *  If the 4-tuple changes without the use of a new connection ID
      (e.g. due to a NAT rebinding), this is considered as a migration
      event.

   The path management specified in Section 9 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]
   fulfills multiple goals: it directs a peer to switch sending through
   a new preferred path, and it allows the peer to release resources
   associated with the old path.  Multipath requires several changes to
   that mechanism:

   *  Allow simultaneous transmission of non-probing frames on multiple
      paths.

   *  Continue using an existing path even if non-probing frames have
      been received on another path.

   *  Manage the removal of paths that have been abandoned.

   As such, this extension specifies a departure from the specification
   of path management in Section 9 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] and therefore
   requires negotiation between the two endpoints using a new transport
   parameter, as specified in Section 3.

   This extension specifies a new Path Identifier (Path ID), which is an
   integer between 0 and 2^32 - 1 (inclusive).  Path identifies are
   generated monotonically increasing and cannot be reused.

   The same Path ID is used in both directions to address a path in the
   new multipath control frames, such as PATH_ABANDON Section 8.2,
   PATH_STANDBY Section 8.3}, PATH_AVAILABLE Section 8.4 as well as
   ACK_MP Section 8.1.  Further, connection IDs are issued per Path ID.
   That means each connection ID is associated with exactly one path
   identifier but multiple connection IDs are usually issued for each
   path identifier.

   The Path ID of the initial path is 0.  Connection IDs which are
   issued by a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame Section 19.15. of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT] respectively are asociated with Path ID 0.  Also,
   the Path ID for the connection ID specified in the "preferred
   address" transport parameter is 0.  Use of the "preferred address" is
   considered as a migration event that does not change the Path ID.

   This extension uses multiple packet number spaces, one for each
   active path.  As such, each path maintains distinct packet number
   states for sending and receiving packets, as in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].
   Using multiple packet number spaces enables direct use of the loss
   recovery and congestion control mechanisms defined in [QUIC-RECOVERY]
   on a per-path basis.

   Using multiple packet number spaces requires changes in the way AEAD
   is applied for packet protection, as explained in Section 5.2.  More
   concretely, the path identifier is used to construct the packet
   protection nonce in addition to the packet number in order to enable
   use of the same packet number on different paths.  Further, tighter
   constraints for key updates are needed, as explained in Section 5.3.

   This specification requires the sender to use a non-zero connection
   ID when opening an additional path.  Some deployments of QUIC use
   zero-length connection IDs.  However, when a node selects to use
   zero-length connection IDs, it is not possible to use different
   connection IDs for distinguishing packets sent to that node over
   different paths.

   Each endhost may use several IP addresses to serve the connection.
   In particular, the multipath extension supports the following
   scenarios.

   *  The client uses multiple IP addresses and the server listens on
      only one.

   *  The client uses only one IP address and the server listens on
      several ones.

   *  The client uses multiple IP addresses and the server listens on
      several ones.

   *  The client uses only one IP address and the server listens on only
      one.

   Note that in the last scenario, it still remains possible to have
   multiple paths over the connection, given that a path is not only
   defined by the IP addresses being used, but also the port numbers.
   In particular, the client can use one or several ports per IP address
   and the server can listen on one or several ports per IP address.

   This proposal does not cover address discovery and management.
   Addresses and the actual decision process to setup or tear down paths
   are assumed to be handled by the application that is using the QUIC
   multipath extension.  This is sufficient to address the first
   aforementioned scenario.  However, this document does not prevent
   future extensions from defining mechanisms to address the remaining
   scenarios.  Further, this proposal only specifies a simple basic
   packet scheduling algorithm, in order to provide some basic
   implementation guidance.  However, more advanced algorithms as well
   as potential extensions to enhance signaling of the current path
   state are expected as future work.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   We assume that the reader is familiar with the terminology used in
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  When this document uses the term "path", it refers
   to the notion of "network path" used in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

2.  High-level overview

   The multipath extensions to QUIC proposed in this document enable the
   simultaneous utilization of different paths to exchange non-probing
   QUIC frames for a single connection.  This contrasts with the base
   QUIC protocol [QUIC-TRANSPORT] that includes a connection migration
   mechanism that selects only one path to exchange such frames.

   A multipath QUIC connection starts with a QUIC handshake as a regular
   QUIC connection.  See further Section 3.  The peers use the
   initial_max_paths transport parameter during the handshake to
   indicate the support of the multipath extension.  A multipath QUIC
   connection is thus an established QUIC connection where the
   initial_max_paths transport parameter was provided by both endpoints.

   To add a new path to an existing multipath QUIC connection, a client
   starts a path validation on the chosen path, as further described in
   Section 4.1.  In this version of the document, a QUIC server does not
   initiate the creation of a path, but it can validate a new path
   created by a client.  A new path can only be used once the associated
   4-tuple has been validated by ensuring that the peer is able to
   receive packets at that address (see Section 8 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).
   The connection ID of a packet binds the packet to a path identifier,
   and therefore to a packet number space.  Further, the path identifier
   is used as numerical identifier in control frames.  E.g. an endpoint
   sends a PATH_ABANDON frame to request its peer to abandon a certain
   path.

   In addition to these core features, an application using the
   multipath extension will typically need additional algorithms to
   handle the number of active paths and how they are used to send
   packets.  As these differ depending on the application's
   requirements, their specification is out of scope of this document.

3.  Handshake Negotiation and Transport Parameter

   This extension defines a new transport parameter, used to negotiate
   the use of the multipath extension during the connection handshake,
   as specified in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  The new transport parameter is
   defined as follows:

   *  initial_max_paths (current version uses 0x0f739bbc1b666d07): the
      initial_max_paths transport parameter is included if the endpoint
      supports the multipath extension as defined in this document.
      This is a variable-length integer value specifying the maximum
      number of active concurrent paths an endpoint is willing to build.
      The value of the initial_max_paths parameter MUST be at least 2.
      An endpoint that receives a value less than 2 MUST close the
      connection with an error of type TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.
      Setting this parameter is equivalent to sending a MAX_PATHS
      (Section 8.7) of the corresponding type with the same value.

   If any of the endpoints does not advertise the initial_max_paths
   transport parameter, then the endpoints MUST NOT use any frame or
   mechanism defined in this document.

   When advertising the initial_max_paths transport parameter, the
   endpoint MUST use non-zero length Source and Destination Connection
   IDs.  If an initial_max_paths transport parameter is received and the
   carrying packet contains a zero-length connection ID, the receiver
   MUST treat this as a connection error of type MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION
   and close the connection.

   The initial_max_paths parameter MUST NOT be remembered (Section 7.4.1
   of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).  New paths can only be used after handshake
   completion.

   This extension does not change the definition of any transport
   parameter defined in Section 18.2. of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   The initial_max_paths transport parameter limits the initial maximum
   number of active paths that can be used during a connection.  The
   active_connection_id_limit transport parameter [QUIC-TRANSPORT]
   limits the maximum number of active connection IDs per path when the
   initial_max_paths parameter is negotiated successfully.  Endpoints
   might prefer to retain spare connection IDs so that they can respond
   to unintentional migration events (Section 9.5 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).

   Cipher suites with nonce shorter than 12 bytes cannot be used
   together with the multipath extension.  If such cipher suite is
   selected and the use of the multipath extension is negotiated,
   endpoints MUST abort the handshake with a TRANSPORT_PARAMETER error.

4.  Path Management

   After completing the handshake, endpoints have agreed to enable
   multipath support.  They can also start using multiple paths, unless
   both server preferred addresses and a disable_active_migration
   transport parameter were provided by the server, in which case a
   client is forbidden to establish new paths until "after a client has
   acted on a preferred_address transport parameter" (Section 18.2. of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).

   This document does not specify how an endpoint that is reachable via
   several addresses announces these addresses to the other endpoint.
   In particular, if the server uses the preferred_address transport
   parameter, clients cannot assume that the initial server address and
   the addresses contained in this parameter can be simultaneously used
   for multipath (Section 9.6.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).  Furthermore, this
   document does not discuss when a client decides to initiate a new
   path.  We delegate such discussion in separate documents.

   To let the peer open a new path, an endpoint needs to provide its
   peer with connection IDs for at least one unused path identifier.
   Endpoints SHOULD use the MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame to provide new
   connection IDs and, respectively, the MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame
   to retire connection IDs after a successful handshake indicating
   multipath support by both endpoints.

   Endpoints MUST NOT issue connection IDs with path identifiers larger
   than the path limitation advertised by the peer, corresponding to the
   maximum value between the peer's initial_max_paths transport
   parameter and received MAX_PATHS frames.

   To open a new path, an endpoint MUST use a connection ID associated
   with a new, unused Path ID.  Still, the receiver may observe a
   connection ID associated with a used Path ID on different 4-tuples
   due to, e.g., NAT rebinding.  In such case, the receiver reacts as
   specified in Section 9.3 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] by initiating path
   validation and using a new connection ID for the same Path ID.

   This proposal adds three multipath control frames for path
   management:

   *  PATH_ABANDON frame for the receiver side to abandon the path (see
      Section 8.2)

   *  PATH_STANDBY and PATH_AVAILABLE frames to express a preference in
      path usage (see Section 8.3 and Section 8.4)

   All new frames are sent in 1-RTT packets [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

4.1.  Path Initiation

   When the multipath option is negotiated, clients that want to use an
   additional path MUST first initiate the Address Validation procedure
   with PATH_CHALLENGE and PATH_RESPONSE frames described in Section 8.2
   of [QUIC-TRANSPORT], unless it has previously validated that address.
   After receiving packets from the client on a new path, if the server
   decides to use the new path, the server MUST perform path validation
   (Section 8.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) unless it has previously validated
   that address.

   If the transport parameter "initial_max_paths" is negotiated as N,
   and the client is already actively using N paths, the limit is
   reached.  If the client wants to start a new path, it has to retire
   one of the established paths.

   Opening a new path requires the use of a new connection ID (see
   Section 9.5 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).  Instead of NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame
   as specified in [QUIC-TRANSPORT], each endpoint uses
   MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames to issue Path ID-specific connections
   IDs.  The same Path ID is used in both directions.  As such to open a
   new path, both sides need at least one connection ID (see
   Section 5.1.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]), which is associated with the
   same, unused Path ID.  If the peer receives the PATH_CHALLENGE, it
   MUST pick a Connection ID with the same path ID for sending the
   PATH_RESPONSE.

   If validation succeeds, the client can continue to use the path.  If
   validation fails, the client MUST NOT use the path and can remove any
   status associated to the path initation attempt.  However, as the
   used Path ID is anyway consumed, and the endpoint MUST abandon the
   path by sending a PATH_ABANDON frame on another path to inform the
   peer that the Path ID cannot be used anymore.

   Section 9.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] introduces the concept of "probing"
   and "non-probing" frames.  When the multipath extension is
   negotiated, the reception of "non-probing" packet on a new path needs
   to be considered as a path initiation attempt that does not impact
   the path status of any existing path.  Therefore, any frame can be
   sent on a new path at any time as long as the anti-amplification
   limits (Section 21.1.1.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) and the congestion
   control limits for this path are respected.

   Further, in contrast with the specification in Section 9 of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT], the server MUST NOT assume that receiving non-
   probing packets on a new path with a new connection ID indicates an
   attempt to migrate to that path.  Instead, servers SHOULD consider
   new paths over which non-probing packets have been received as
   available for transmission.  Reception of QUIC packets on a new path
   containing a connection ID that is already in use on another path
   should be considered as a path migration as further discussed in
   Section 7.8.

   As specified in Section 9.3 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT], the server is
   expected to send a new address validation token to a client following
   the successful validation of a new client address.  In situations
   where multiple paths are activated, the client may be recipient of
   several tokens, each tied to a different address.  When considering
   using a token for subsequent connections, the client ought to
   carefully select the token to use, due to the inherent ambiguity
   associated with determining the exact address to which a token is
   bound.  To alleviate such a token ambiguity issue, a server may issue
   a token that is capable of validating any of the previously validated
   addresses.  Further guidance on token usage can be found in
   Section 8.1.3 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

4.2.  Path State Management

   An endpoint uses PATH_STANDBY and PATH_AVAILABLE frames to inform
   that the peer should send packets in the preference expressed by
   these frames.  Note that the endpoint might not follow the peer’s
   advertisements, but these frames are still a clear signal of
   suggestion for the preference of path usage by the peer.  Each peer
   indicates its preference of path usage independently of the other
   peer.  It means that peers may have different usage preferences for
   the same path.  Depending on the sender's decisions, this may lead to
   usage of paths that have been indicated as "standby" by the peer or
   non-usage of some locally available paths.

   PATH_AVAILABLE indicates that a path is "available", i.e., it
   suggests to the peer to use its own logic to split traffic among
   available paths.  PATH_STANDBY marks a path as "standby", i.e., it
   suggests that no traffic should be sent on that path if another path
   is available.  If no frame indicating a path usage preference was
   received for a certain path, the preference of the peer is unknown
   and the sender needs to decide based on it own local logic if the
   path should be used.

   Endpoints use Path Identifier in these frames to identify which path
   state is going to be changed.  Notice that both frames can be sent
   via a different path and therefore might arrive in different orders.
   The PATH_AVAILABLE and PATH_STANDBY frames share a common sequence
   number space to detect and ignore outdated information.

   If all available path are marked as "standby", no guidance is
   provided about which path should be used preferably.

4.3.  Path Close

   Each endpoint manages the set of paths that are available for
   transmission.  At any time in the connection, each endpoint can
   decide to abandon one of these paths, following for example changes
   in local connectivity or changes in local preferences.  After an
   endpoint abandons a path, the peer will not receive any more non-
   probing packets on that path.  Non-probing packets are defined in
   Section 9.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   An endpoint that wants to close a path SHOULD use explicit request to
   terminate the path by sending the PATH_ABANDON frame (see
   Section 4.3.1).  Note that while abandoning a path will cause
   connection ID retirement, only retiring the associated connection ID
   does not necessarily advertise path abandon (see Section 4.3.4).
   However, implicit signals such as idle time or packet losses might be
   the only way for an endhost to detect path closure (see
   Section 4.3.5).

   Note that other explicit closing mechanisms of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] still
   apply on the whole connection.  In particular, the reception of
   either a CONNECTION_CLOSE (Section 10.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) or a
   Stateless Reset (Section 10.3 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) closes the
   connection.

4.3.1.  Use PATH_ABANDON Frame to Close a Path

   Both endpoints, namely the client and the server, can initiate path
   closure, by sending a PATH_ABANDON frame (see Section 8.2) which
   requests the peer to stop sending packets with the corresponding Path
   Identifier.

   Usually, it is expected that the PATH_ABANDON frame is used by the
   client to indicate to the server that path conditions have changed
   such that the path is or will be not usable anymore, e.g. in case of
   a mobility event.  The PATH_ABANDON frame therefore recommends to the
   receiver that no packets should be sent on that path anymore.  In
   addition, the MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame is used indicate to the
   receiving peer that the sender will not send any packets associated
   to the connection ID used on that path anymore.  The receiver of a
   PATH_ABANDON frame MAY also send a PATH_ABANDON frame to indicate its
   own unwillingness to receive any packet on this path anymore.

   The PATH_ABANDON frame is retires the associated Path Identifier.
   When an endpoint receives a PATH_ABANDON frame, it SHOULD NOT use the
   associated Path Identifier in future packets, except in ACK_MP frames
   for inflight packets and in MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames for CID
   retirement.

   PATH_ABANDON frames can be sent on any path, not only the path that
   is intended to be closed.  Thus, a path can be abandoned even if
   connectivity on that path is already broken.  Respectively, if there
   is still an active path, it is RECOMMENDED to send a PATH_ABANDON
   frame after an idle time on another path.

   When a path is abandoned, all CIDs allocated by both of the endpoints
   for the specified Path ID need to be retired.  When sending or
   receiving a PATH_ABANDON frame, endpoints SHOULD wait for at least
   three times the current Probe Timeout (PTO) interval after the last
   packet was sent on the path, as defined in Section 6.2 of
   [QUIC-RECOVERY], before sending MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames.  This
   is inline with the requirement of Section 10.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].
   Both endpoints SHOULD send MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames for all
   connection IDs associated to the Path ID of the abandoned path to
   ensure that paths close cleanly and that delayed or reordered packets
   are properly discarded.  The effect of receiving a
   MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame is specified in the next section.

   If a PATH_ABANDON frame is received for the only active path of a
   QUIC connection, the receiving peer SHOULD send a CONNECTION_CLOSE
   frame and enter the closing state.  If the client received a
   PATH_ABANDON frame for the last open path, it MAY instead try to open
   a new path, if available, and only initiate connection closure if
   path validation fails or a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame is received from
   the server.  Similarly the server MAY wait for a short, limited time
   such as one PTO if a path probing packet is received on a new path
   before sending the CONNECTION_CLOSE frame.

4.3.2.  Refusing a New Path

   An endpoint may deny the establishment of a new path initiated by its
   peer during the address validation procedure.  According to
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT], the standard way to deny the establishment of a
   path is to not send a PATH_RESPONSE in response to the peer's
   PATH_CHALLENGE.

   A failed path validation consumes the Path ID used for probing of
   this path.  An endpoint MUST not use the same Path ID to probe a
   different path.  Instead, it MUST send a PATH_ABANDON frame to retire
   the Path ID.

4.3.3.  Allocating, Consuming and Retiring Connection IDs

   Each connection ID is associated with a Path ID.  The Path Identifier
   0 indicates the initial path of the connection.  Endpoints SHOULD
   issue at least one unused connection ID with unused Path Identifier.

   An endpoint maintains a set of connection IDs received from its peer
   for each path, any of which it can use when sending packets, as the
   same in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  The difference of the multipath extension
   is that connection IDs are pre-allocated for each paths.  Each
   connection ID belongs to one path specified by the Path Identifier
   field of MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame in Section 8.5.  The connection
   IDs used during the handshake belong to the initial path with Path
   Identifier 0.

   Sending a MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame indicates that the connection
   ID cannot be used anymore.  If the path is still active, the peer
   SHOULD replace it with a new connection ID using a
   MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame.

   Note that Connection Sequeunce number and Retire Prior To field are
   both used for the corresponding path specified by a Path Identifier.

   Upon receipt of an increased Retire Prior To field, the peer MUST
   stop using the corresponding connection IDs of the specified path and
   retire them with MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames before adding the
   newly provided connection ID to the set of active connection IDs
   belonging to the specified path.

   Endpoints MUST NOT issue new connection IDs which has Path
   Identifiers larger than the max path identifier field in MP_MAX_PATHS
   frames Section 8.7.  When endpoint finds it has not enough available
   unused Path Identifiers, it SHOULD send a MP_MAX_PATHS frame to
   inform the peer that it could use larger active Path Identifiers.

4.3.4.  Effect of MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID Frame

   Receiving a MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame causes an endpoint to
   discard the resources associated with that connection ID.  Note that
   retirement of connection IDs will not retire the Path Identifier for
   the specific path.  The list of received packets used to send
   acknowledgements also remains unaffected as the packet number space
   is associated with a path.

   The peer, that sends the MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame, can keep
   sending data using the same IP addresses and UDP ports previously
   associated with that connection ID, but has to use a different
   connection ID when doing so.  If no new connection ID is available
   anymore, the endpoint cannot send on this path.  This can happen if,
   e.g., the connection ID issuer requests retirement of a connection ID
   using the Retire Prior To field in the NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame but
   does provide sufficient new CIDs.

   Note that even if a peer cannot send on a path anymore because it
   does not have a valid connection ID to use, it can still acknowledge
   packets received on the path, by sending ACK_MP frames on another
   path, if available.  Also note that, as there is no valid CID
   associated with the path, both endpoints can still send multipath
   control frames that contain the Path Identifier on available paths,
   such as PATH_ABANDON, PATH_STANDBY or PATH_AVAILABLE.

   If the peer cannot send on a path and no data is received on the
   path, the idle time-out will close the path.  If, before the idle
   timer expires, a new connection ID gets issued by its peer, the
   endpoint can re-activate the path by sending a packet with a new
   connection ID on that path.

   If the sender retires a connection ID that is still used by in-flight
   packets, it may receive ACK_MP frames referencing the retired
   connection ID.  If the sender stops tracking sent packets with
   retired connection ID, these would be spuriously marked as lost.  To
   avoid such performance issue without keeping retired connection ID
   state, an endpoint should first stop sending packets with the to-be-
   retired connection ID, then wait for all in-flight packets to be
   either acknowledged or marked as lost, and finally retire the
   connection ID.

4.3.5.  Idle Timeout

   [QUIC-TRANSPORT] allows for closing of connections if they stay idle
   for too long.  The connection idle timeout in multipath QUIC is
   defined as "no packet received on any path for the duration of the
   idle timeout".  When only one path is available, servers MUST follow
   the specifications in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   When more than one path is available, hosts shall monitor the arrival
   of non-probing packets and the acknowledgements for the packets sent
   over each path.  Hosts SHOULD stop sending traffic on a path if for
   at least the period of the idle timeout as specified in Section 10.1.
   of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] (a) no non-probing packet was received or (b) no
   non-probing packet sent over this path was acknowledged, but MAY
   ignore that rule if it would disqualify all available paths.  To
   avoid idle timeout of a path, endpoints can send ack-eliciting
   packets such as packets containing PING frames (Section 19.2 of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) on that path to keep it alive.  Sending periodic
   PING frames also helps prevent middlebox timeout, as discussed in
   Section 10.1.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   Server MAY release the resource associated with paths for which no
   non-probing packet was received for a sufficiently long path-idle
   delay, but SHOULD only release resource for the last available path
   if no traffic is received for the duration of the idle timeout, as
   specified in Section 10.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  This means if all
   paths remain idle for the idle timeout, the connection is implicitly
   closed.

   Server implementations need to select the sub-path idle timeout as a
   trade- off between keeping resources, such as connection IDs, in use
   for an excessive time or having to promptly reestablish a path after
   a spurious estimate of path abandonment by the client.

4.4.  Path States

   Figure 1 shows the states that an endpoint's path can have.

          o
          | PATH_CHALLENGE sent/received on new path
          v

    |   Closed   |<---------------------------------+
    +------------+

                         Figure 1: States of a path

   In non-final states, hosts have to track the following information.

   *  Associated 4-tuple: The tuple (source IP, source port, destination
      IP, destination port) used by the endhost to send packets over the
      path.

   *  Associated Path Identifier: The Path Identifier used to address
      the path.  The endpoint relies on its sequence number to send path
      control information and specifically acknowledge packets belonging
      to that path-specific packet number space.

   *  Associated Destination Connection ID: The connection ID used to
      send packets over the path.

   In Active state, hosts MUST also track the following information:

   *  Associated Source Connection ID: The connection ID used to receive
      packets over the path.

   A path in the "Validating" state performs path validation as
   described in Section 8.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   The endhost can use all the paths in the "Active" state, provided
   that the congestion control and flow control currently allow sending
   of new data on a path.  Note that if a path became idle due to a
   timeout, the endpoint SHOULD send a PATH_ABANDON frame before closing
   the path.

   In the "Closing" state, the endhost SHOULD NOT send packets on this
   path anymore, as there is no guarantee that the peer can still map
   the packets to the connection.  The endhost SHOULD wait for the
   acknowledgment of the PATH_ABANDON frame before moving the path to
   the "Closed" state to ensure a graceful termination of the path.

   When a path reaches the "Closed" state, the endhost releases all the
   path's associated resources, including the associated connection IDs.
   Endpoints SHOULD send MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames for releasing
   the associated connection IDs following [QUIC-TRANSPORT].
   Considering endpoints are not expected to send packets on the current
   path in the "Closed" state, endpoints can send
   MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames on other available paths.
   Consequently, the endhost is not able to send nor receive packets on
   this path anymore.

5.  Multipath Operation with Multiple Packet Number Spaces

   The QUIC multipath extension uses different packet number spaces for
   each path.  This also means that the same packet number can occur on
   each path and the packet number is not a unique identifier anymore.
   This requires changes to the ACK frame as well as packet protection
   as described in the following subsections.

   When multipath is negotiated, each Path Identifier is linked to a
   separate packet number space.  Each PathID-specific packet number
   space starts at packet number 0.  When following the packet number
   encoding algorithm described in Appendix A.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT], the
   largest packet number (largest_acked) that has been acknowledged by
   the peer in this new CID's packet number space is initially set to
   "None".

5.1.  Sending Acknowledgements

   The ACK_MP frame, as specified in Section 8.1, is used to acknowledge
   1-RTT packets.  Compared to the QUIC version 1 ACK frame, the ACK_MP
   frame additionally contains the receiver's Path Identifier associated
   with the Destination Connection ID to distinguish the path-specific
   packet number space.

   Acknowledgements of Initial and Handshake packets MUST be carried
   using ACK frames, as specified in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  The ACK frames,
   as defined in [QUIC-TRANSPORT], do not carry the Destination
   Connection ID Path Identifier field to identify the packet number
   space.  If the multipath extension has been successfully negotiated,
   ACK frames in 1-RTT packets acknowledge packets sent with the
   connection ID having path identifier 0.

   As soon as the negotiation of multipath support is completed,
   endpoints SHOULD use ACK_MP frames instead of ACK frames to
   acknowledge application data packets, including 0-RTT packets, using
   the initial connection ID with path identifier 0 after the handshake
   concluded.

   ACK_MP frames (defined in Section 8.1) can be returned on any path.
   If the ACK_MP is preferred to be sent on the same path as the
   acknowledged packet (see Section 7.3 for further guidance), it can be
   beneficial to bundle an ACK_MP frame with the PATH_RESPONSE frame
   during path validation.

5.2.  Packet Protection

   Packet protection for QUIC version 1 is specified in Section 5 of
   [QUIC-TLS].  The general principles of packet protection are not
   changed for QUIC Multipath.  No changes are needed for setting packet
   protection keys, initial secrets, header protection, use of 0-RTT
   keys, receiving out-of-order protected packets, receiving protected
   packets, or retry packet integrity.  However, the use of multiple
   number spaces for 1-RTT packets requires changes in AEAD usage.

   Section 5.3 of [QUIC-TLS] specifies AEAD usage, and in particular the
   use of a nonce, N, formed by combining the packet protection IV with
   the packet number.  When multiple packet number spaces are used, the
   packet number alone would not guarantee the uniqueness of the nonce.

   In order to guarantee the uniqueness of the nonce, the nonce N is
   calculated by combining the packet protection IV with the packet
   number and with the least significant 32 bits of the path identifier
   pre-allocated for the Destination Connection ID.

   Section 8.5 encodes the Path Identifier for connection IDs as a
   variable-length integer, allowing values up to 2^32-1; in this
   specification, a range of less than 2^32-1 values MUST be used before
   updating the packet protection key.

   To calculate the nonce, a 96 bit path-and-packet-number is composed
   of the least significant 32 bits of the Path Identifier in network
   byte order, two zero bits, and the 62 bits of the reconstructed QUIC
   packet number in network byte order.  If the IV is larger than 96
   bits, the path-and-packet-number is left-padded with zeros to the
   size of the IV.  The exclusive OR of the padded packet number and the
   IV forms the AEAD nonce.

   For example, assuming the IV value is 6b26114b9cba2b63a9e8dd4f, the
   Path Identifier is 3, and the packet number is aead, the nonce will
   be set to 6b2611489cba2b63a9e873e2.

   Due to the way the nonce is constructed, endpoints MUST NOT use more
   than 2^32 connection IDs without a key update.

5.3.  Key Update

   The Key Phase bit update process for QUIC version 1 is specified in
   Section 6 of [QUIC-TLS].  The general principles of key update are
   not changed in this specification.  Following QUIC version 1, the Key
   Phase bit is used to indicate which packet protection keys are used
   to protect the packet.  The Key Phase bit is toggled to signal each
   subsequent key update.

   Because of network delays, packets protected with the older key might
   arrive later than the packets protected with the new key, however
   receivers can solely rely on the Key Phase bit to determine the
   corresponding packet protection key, assuming that there is
   sufficient interval between two consecutive key updates (Section 6.5
   of [QUIC-TLS]).

   When this specification is used, endpoints SHOULD wait for at least
   three times the largest PTO among all the paths before initiating a
   new key update after receiving an acknowledgement that confirms
   receipt of the previous key update.  This interval is different from
   that of QUIC version 1 which used three times the PTO of the only one
   active path.

   Following Section 5.4 of [QUIC-TLS], the Key Phase bit is protected,
   so sending multiple packets with Key Phase bit flipping at the same
   time should not cause linkability issue.

6.  Examples

6.1.  Path Establishment

   Figure 2 illustrates an example of new path establishment using
   multiple packet number spaces.

      Client                                                  Server

      (Exchanges start on default path)
      1-RTT[]: MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID[C1, Seq=0, PathID=1] -->
                <-- 1-RTT[]: MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID[S1, Seq=0, PathID=1]
                <-- 1-RTT[]: MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID[S2, Seq=0, PathID=2]
      ...
      (starts new path)
      1-RTT[0]: DCID=S2, PATH_CHALLENGE[X] -->
                      Checks AEAD using nonce(CID sequence 2, PN 0)
        <-- 1-RTT[0]: DCID=C1, PATH_RESPONSE[X], PATH_CHALLENGE[Y],
                                                 ACK_MP[PID=2,PN=0]
      Checks AEAD using nonce(CID sequence 1, PN 0)
      1-RTT[1]: DCID=S2, PATH_RESPONSE[Y],
                ACK_MP[PID=1, PN=0], ... -->

                Figure 2: Example of new path establishment

   In Figure 2, the endpoints first exchange new available connection
   IDs with the NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame.  In this example, the client
   provides one connection ID (C1 with Path Identifier 1), and server
   provides two connection IDs (S1 with Path Identifier 1, and S2 with
   Path Identifier 2).

   Before the client opens a new path by sending a packet on that path
   with a PATH_CHALLENGE frame, it has to check whether there is an
   unused connection IDs available for each side.  In this example, the
   client chooses the connection ID S2 as the Destination Connection ID
   in the new path.

   If the client has used all the allocated CID, it is supposed to
   retire those that are not used anymore, and the server is supposed to
   provide replacements, as specified in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  Usually, it
   is desired to provide one more connection ID as currently in use, to
   allow for new paths or migration.

6.2.  Path Closure

   In this example, the client detects the network environment change
   (client's 4G/Wi-Fi is turned off, Wi-Fi signal is fading to a
   threshold, or the quality of RTT or loss rate is becoming worse) and
   wants to close the initial path.

   Figure 3 illustrates an example of path closing.  For the first path,
   the server's 1-RTT packets use DCID C1, which has a path identifier
   of 1; the client's 1-RTT packets use DCID S2, which has a path
   identifier of 2.  For the second path, the server's 1-RTT packets use
   DCID C2, which has a path identifier of 2; the client's 1-RTT packets
   use DCID S3, which has a path identifier of 3.  Note that the paths
   use different packet number spaces.  In this case, the client is
   going to close the first path.  It identifies the path by the Path
   Identifier of the DCID its peer uses for sending packets over that
   path, hence using the DCID with path identifier 1 (which relates to
   C1).  Optionally, the server confirms the path closure by sending an
   PATH_ABANDON frame by indicating the path identifier the client uses
   to send over that path, which corresponds to the path identifier 2
   (of S2).  Both the client and the server can close the path after
   receiving the RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame for that path.

Client                                                      Server

(client tells server to abandon a path)
1-RTT[X]: DCID=S2 PATH_ABANDON[PathID=1]->
                           (server tells client to abandon a path)
               <-1-RTT[Y]: DCID=C1 PATH_ABANDON[PathID=2],
                                               ACK_MP[PID=2, PN=X]
(client retires the corresponding CID)
1-RTT[U]: DCID=S3 MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID[PathId=2, Seq=0], ACK_MP[PID=1, PN=Y] ->
                            (server retires the corresponding CID)
 <- 1-RTT[V]: DCID=C2 RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID[1], ACK_MP[PID=3, PN=U]

                 Figure 3: Example of closing a path.

   After a path is abandoned, the Path Identifier associated with the
   path is considered retired and MUST NOT be reused in new paths for
   security consideration Section 5.2.

   Endpoint SHOULD send MAX_PATHS frames Section 8.7 to raise the limit
   of Path Identifiers when endpoint finds there are not enough unused
   Path Identifiers (e.g. more than half of the available Path
   Identifiers are used).

7.  Implementation Considerations

7.1.  Number Spaces

   As stated in Section 1, when multipath is negotiated, each Path
   Identifier is linked to a separate packet number space.  This a big
   difference between implementations of QUIC as specified in
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT], which only have to manage three number spaces for
   Initial, Handshake and Application packets.

   Implementation of multipath capable QUIC will need to carefully model
   the relations between paths and number spaces, as shown in Figure 4.

      +-------------------------+
      | CID received from peer: |-- - - - - - +
      | Sender Number Space     |             |
      +-------------------------+             v
                         ^             +----------------+
                         |             | Path (4 tuple) |
                         +-------------| - RTT          |
                   +------------------>| - Congestion   |
                   |                   |   state        |
                   v                   +----------------+
      +-------------------------+             ^
      | CID provided to peer:   |             |
      | Receiver Number Space   |-- - - - - - +
      +-------------------------+

                  Figure 4: Send and Receive number spaces

   The path is defined by the 4-tuple through which packets are received
   and sent.  Packets sent on the path will include the Destination
   Connection ID currently used for that path, selected from the list of
   CID provided by the peer.  Packets received on the path carry a
   Destination CID selected by the peer from the list provided to that
   peer.

   The relation between packet number spaces and paths is fixed.  CIDs
   are pre-allocated for each Path Identifier.  Once CIDs are issued,
   they are assigned to one specific Path Identifier.  A node may decide
   to rotate the Destination CID it uses, a NAT may decide to change the
   4-tuple over which packets from that path will be received.  The
   packet number space does not change when CID rotation happens within
   a given Path ID.

   Data associated with the transmission and reception on a given path
   can be associated to either the "path state", or to the state of
   either the sender or receiver number spaces.  For example:

   *  RTT measurements and congestion state are logically associated
      with the 4-tuple.  They will remain unchanged if data starts being
      received or sent through the same 4-tuple using new CIDs.

   *  Implementations of loss recovery typically maintain lists of
      packets sent and not yet acknowledged.  Such information, along
      with the value of the next PN to use for sending, is logically
      associated with the "Sender Number Space", which remain unchanged
      when CID rotation happens.

   *  Sending of acknowledgement requires keeping track of the PN of
      received packets and of acknowledgements previously sent.  Such
      information is logically associated with the "Receiver Number
      Space", which remain unchanged when CID rotation happens.

7.2.  Congestion Control

   When the QUIC multipath extension is used, senders manage per-path
   congestion status as required in Section 9.4 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].
   However, in [QUIC-TRANSPORT] only one active path is assumed and as
   such the requirement is to reset the congestion control status on
   path migration.  With the multipath extension, multiple paths can be
   used simultaneously, therefore separate congestion control state is
   maintained for each path.  This means a sender is not allowed to send
   more data on a given path than congestion control for that path
   indicates.

   When a Multipath QUIC connection uses two or more paths, there is no
   guarantee that these paths are fully disjoint.  When two (or more
   paths) share the same bottleneck, using a standard congestion control
   scheme could result in an unfair distribution of the bandwidth with
   the multipath connection getting more bandwidth than competing single
   paths connections.  Multipath TCP uses the LIA congestion control
   scheme specified in [RFC6356] to solve this problem.  This scheme can
   immediately be adapted to Multipath QUIC.  Other coupled congestion
   control schemes have been proposed for Multipath TCP such as [OLIA].

7.3.  Computing Path RTT

   Acknowledgement delays are the sum of two one-way delays, the delay
   on the packet sending path and the delay on the return path chosen
   for the acknowledgements.  When different paths have different
   characteristics, this can cause acknowledgement delays to vary
   widely.  Consider for example a multipath transmission using both a
   terrestrial path, with a latency of 50ms in each direction, and a
   geostationary satellite path, with a latency of 300ms in both
   directions.  The acknowledgement delay will depend on the combination
   of paths used for the packet transmission and the ACK transmission,
   as shown in Table 1.

            +======================+=============+===========+
            | ACK Path \ Data path | Terrestrial | Satellite |
            +======================+=============+===========+
            | Terrestrial          | 100ms       | 350ms     |
            +----------------------+-------------+-----------+
            | Satellite            | 350ms       | 600ms     |
            +----------------------+-------------+-----------+

              Table 1: Example of ACK delays using multiple
                                  paths

   The ACK_MP frames describe packets that were sent on the specified
   path, but they may be received through any available path.  There is
   an understandable concern that if successive acknowledgements are
   received on different paths, the measured RTT samples will fluctuate
   widely, and that might result in poor performance.  While this may be
   a concern, the actual behavior is complex.

   The computed values reflect both the state of the network path and
   the scheduling decisions by the sender of the ACK_MP frames.  In the
   example above, we may assume that the ACK_MP will be sent over the
   terrestrial link, because that provides the best response time.  In
   that case, the computed RTT value for the satellite path will be
   about 350ms.  This lower than the 600ms that would be measured if the
   ACK_MP came over the satellite channel, but it is still the right
   value for computing for example the PTO timeout: if an ACK_MP is not
   received after more than 350ms, either the data packet or its ACK_MP
   were probably lost.

   The simplest implementation is to compute smoothedRTT and RTTvar per
   Section 5.3 of [QUIC-RECOVERY] regardless of the path through which
   MP_ACKs are received.  This algorithm will provide good results,
   except if the set of paths changes and the ACK_MP sender revisits its
   sending preferences.  This is not very different from what happens on
   a single path if the routing changes.  The RTT, RTT variance and PTO
   estimates will rapidly converge to reflect the new conditions.  There
   is however an exception: some congestion control functions rely on
   estimates of the minimum RTT.  It might be prudent for nodes to
   remember the path over which the ACK MP that produced the minimum RTT
   was received, and to restart the minimum RTT computation if that path
   is abandoned.

7.4.  Packet Scheduling

   The transmission of QUIC packets on a regular QUIC connection is
   regulated by the arrival of data from the application and the
   congestion control scheme.  QUIC packets that increase the number of
   bytes in flight can only be sent when the congestion window allows
   it.  Multipath QUIC implementations also need to include a packet
   scheduler that decides, among the paths whose congestion window is
   open, the path over which the next QUIC packet will be sent.  Most
   frames, including control frames (PATH_CHALLENGE and PATH_RESPONSE
   being the notable exceptions), can be sent and received on any active
   path.  The scheduling is a local decision, based on the preferences
   of the application and the implementation.

   Note that this implies that an endpoint may send and receive ACK_MP
   frames on a path different from the one that carried the acknowledged
   packets.  As noted in Section 7.3 the values computed using the
   standard algorithm reflect both the characteristics of the path and
   the scheduling algorithm of ACK_MP frames.  The estimates will
   converge faster if the scheduling strategy is stable, but besides
   that implementations can choose between multiple strategies such as
   sending ACK_MP frames on the path they acknowledge packets, or
   sending ACK_MP frames on the shortest path, which results in shorter
   control loops and thus better performance.

7.5.  Retransmissions

   Simultaneous use of multiple paths enables different retransmission
   strategies to cope with losses such as: a) retransmitting lost frames
   over the same path, b) retransmitting lost frames on a different or
   dedicated path, and c) duplicate lost frames on several paths (not
   recommended for general purpose use due to the network overhead).
   While this document does not preclude a specific strategy, more
   detailed specification is out of scope.

7.6.  Handling different PMTU sizes

   An implementation should take care to handle different PMTU sizes
   across multiple paths.  One simple option if the PMTUs are relatively
   similar is to apply the minimum PMTU of all paths to each path.  The
   benefit of such an approach is to simplify retransmission processing
   as the content of lost packets initially sent on one path can be sent
   on another path without further frame scheduling adaptations.

7.7.  Keep Alive

   The QUIC specification defines an optional keep alive process, see
   Section 5.3 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  Implementations of the multipath
   extension should map this keep alive process to a number of paths.
   Some applications may wish to ensure that one path remains active,
   while others could prefer to have two or more active paths during the
   connection lifetime.  Different applications will likely require
   different strategies.  Once the implementation has decided which
   paths to keep alive, it can do so by sending Ping frames on each of
   these paths before the idle timeout expires.

7.8.  Connection ID Changes and NAT Rebindings

   Section 5.1.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] indicates that an endpoint can
   change the connection ID it uses for to another available one at any
   time during the connection.  As such a sole change of the Connection
   ID without any change in the address does not indicate a path change
   and the endpoint can keep the same congestion control and RTT
   measurement state.

   While endpoints assign a connection ID to a specific sending 4-tuple,
   networks events such as NAT rebinding may make the packet's receiver
   observe a different 4-tuple.  Servers observing a 4-tuple change will
   perform path validation (see Section 9 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).  If path
   validation process succeeds, the endpoints set the path's congestion
   controller and round-trip time estimator according to Section 9.4 of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   Section 9.3 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] allows an endpoint to skip validation
   of a peer address if that address has been seen recently.  However,
   when the multipath extension is used and an endpoint has multiple
   addresses that could lead to switching between different paths, it
   should rather maintain multiple open paths instead.

   If an endpoint uses a new connection ID after an idle period and a
   NAT rebinding leads to a 4-tuple changes on the same packet, the
   receiving endpoint may not be able to associate the packet to an
   existing path and will therefore consider this as a new path.  This
   leads to an inconsistent view of open paths at both peers, however,
   as the "old" path will not work anymore, it will be silently closed
   after the idle timeout expires.

8.  New Frames

   All the new frames MUST only be sent in 1-RTT packet.

   If an endpoint receives a multipath-specific frame in a different
   packet type, it MUST close the connection with an error of type
   FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.

   All multipath-specific frames relate to a Path Identifier of
   Destination Connection ID.  If an endpoint receives a Path Identifier
   greater than any previously sent to the peer, it MUST treat this as a
   connection error of type MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.  If an endpoint
   receives a multipath-specific frame with a Path Identifier that it
   cannot process anymore (e.g., because the path might have been
   abandoned), it MUST silently ignore the frame.

8.1.  ACK_MP Frame

   The ACK_MP frame (types TBD-00 and TBD-01) is an extension of the ACK
   frame defined by [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  It is used to acknowledge packets
   that were sent on different paths using multiple packet number
   spaces.  If the frame type is TBD-01, ACK_MP frames also contain the
   sum of QUIC packets with associated ECN marks received on the
   acknowledged packet number space up to this point.

   ACK_MP frame is formatted as shown in Figure 5.

     ACK_MP Frame {
       Type (i) = TBD-00..TBD-01
            (experiments use  0x15228c00-0x15228c01),
       Path Identifier (i),
       Largest Acknowledged (i),
       ACK Delay (i),
       ACK Range Count (i),
       First ACK Range (i),
       ACK Range (..) ...,
       [ECN Counts (..)],
     }

                       Figure 5: ACK_MP Frame Format

   Compared to the ACK frame specified in [QUIC-TRANSPORT], the
   following field is added.

   Path Identifier:  The path identifier associated with the packet
      number space of the 0-RTT and 1-RTT packets which are acknowledged
      by the ACK_MP frame.

8.2.  PATH_ABANDON Frame

   The PATH_ABANDON frame informs the peer to abandon a path and retire
   the associated Path ID.

   When there is not enough unused Path Identifiers, endpoints SHOULD
   send MAX_PATHS frame to inform the peer that new Path Identifiers are
   available.

   PATH_ABANDON frames are formatted as shown in Figure 6.

     PATH_ABANDON Frame {
       Type (i) = TBD-02 (experiments use 0x15228c05),
       Path Identifier (i),
       Error Code (i),
       Reason Phrase Length (i),
       Reason Phrase (..),
     }

                    Figure 6: PATH_ABANDON Frame Format

   PATH_ABANDON frames contain the following fields:

   Path Identifier:  The Path Identifier to abandon.

   Error Code:  A variable-length integer that indicates the reason for
      abandoning this path.

   Reason Phrase Length:  A variable-length integer specifying the
      length of the reason phrase in bytes.  Because an PATH_ABANDON
      frame cannot be split between packets, any limits on packet size
      will also limit the space available for a reason phrase.

   Reason Phrase:  Additional diagnostic information for the closure.
      This can be zero length if the sender chooses not to give details
      beyond the Error Code value.  This SHOULD be a UTF-8 encoded
      string [RFC3629], though the frame does not carry information,
      such as language tags, that would aid comprehension by any entity
      other than the one that created the text.

   PATH_ABANDON frames are ack-eliciting.  If a packet containing a
   PATH_ABANDON frame is considered lost, the peer SHOULD repeat it.

   Once a Path ID is retired by PATH_ABANDON, endpoints MUST NOT send
   packets associated with that Path ID anymore, even on other network
   paths.

8.3.  PATH_STANDBY frame

   PATH_STANDBY Frames are used by endpoints to inform the peer about
   its preference to not use the path associated to the Destination
   Connection IDs in the frame for sending.  PATH_STANDBY frames are
   formatted as shown in Figure 7.

     PATH_STANDBY Frame {
       Type (i) = TBD-03 (experiments use 0x15228c07)
       Path Identifier (i),
       Path Status sequence number (i),
     }

                    Figure 7: PATH_STANDBY Frame Format

   PATH_STANDBY Frames contain the following fields:

   Path Identifier:  The Path Identifier the status update corresponds
      to.  All Path IDs that have been issued MAY be specified, even if
      they are not yet in use over a path.

   Path Status sequence number:  A variable-length integer specifying
      the sequence number assigned for this PATH_STANDBY frame.  The
      sequence number space is shared with the PATH_AVAILABLE frame and
      the sequence number MUST be monotonically increasing generated by
      the sender of the PATH_STANDBY frame in the same connection.  The
      receiver of the PATH_STANDBY frame needs to use and compare the
      sequence numbers separately for each Path Identifier.

   Frames may be received out of order.  A peer MUST ignore an incoming
   PATH_STANDBY frame if it previously received another PATH_STANDBY
   frame or PATH_AVAILABLE for the same Path Identifier with a Path
   Status sequence number equal to or higher than the Path Status
   sequence number of the incoming frame.

   PATH_STANDBY frames are ack-eliciting.  If a packet containing a
   PATH_STANDBY frame is considered lost, the peer SHOULD resend the
   frame only if it contains the last status sent for that path -- as
   indicated by the sequence number.

   A PATH_STANDBY frame MAY be bundled with a MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame
   or a PATH_RESPONSE frame in order to indicate the preferred path
   usage before or during path initiation.

8.4.  PATH_AVAILABLE frame

   PATH_AVAILABLE frames are used by endpoints to inform the peer that
   the path associated to the Destination Connection IDs in the frame is
   available for sending.  PATH_AVAILABLE frames are formatted as shown
   in Figure 8.

     PATH_AVAILABLE Frame {
       Type (i) = TBD-03 (experiments use 0x15228c08),
       Path Identifier (i),
       Path Status sequence number (i),
     }

                   Figure 8: PATH_AVAILABLE Frame Format

   PATH_AVAILABLE frames contain the following fields:

   Path Identifier:  The Path Identifier the status update corresponds
      to.

   Path Status sequence number:  A variable-length integer specifying
      the sequence number assigned for this PATH_AVAILABLE frame.  The
      sequence number space is shared with the PATH_STANDBY frame and
      the sequence number MUST be monotonically increasing generated by
      the sender of the PATH_AVAILABLE frame in the same connection.
      The receiver of the PATH_AVAILABLE frame needs to use and compare
      the sequence numbers separately for each Path Identifier.

   Frames may be received out of order.  A peer MUST ignore an incoming
   PATH_AVAILABLE frame if it previously received another PATH_AVAILABLE
   frame or PATH_STANDBY frame for the same Path Identifier with a Path
   Status sequence number equal to or higher than the Path Status
   sequence number of the incoming frame.

   PATH_AVAILABLE frames are ack-eliciting.  If a packet containing a
   PATH_AVAILABLE frame is considered lost, the peer SHOULD resend the
   frame only if it contains the last status sent for that path -- as
   indicated by the sequence number.

   A PATH_AVAILABLE frame MAY be bundled with a MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID
   frame or a PATH_RESPONSE frame in order to indicate the preferred
   path usage before or during path initiation.

8.5.  MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames

   An endpoint sends a MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame (type=0x15228c09)
   instead of the NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame to provide its peer with
   alternative connection IDs that can be used to break linkability when
   migrating connections; see Section 19.15 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames are formatted as shown in Figure 9.

   MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID Frame {
     Type (i) = 0x15228c09,
     Path Identifier (i),
     Sequence Number (i),
     Retire Prior To (i),
     Length (8),
     Connection ID (8..160),
     Stateless Reset Token (128),
   }

                Figure 9: MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID Frame Format

   MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames contain the following fields:

   Path Identifier:  A path identifier which is pre allocated when the
      connection ID is generated, which means the current connection ID
      can only be used on the corresponding path.

   Sequence Number: The sequence number assigned to the connection ID by
   the sender on the path specified by Path Identifier, encoded as a
   variable-length integer.  Note that the sequence number is allocated
   dependently on each path, which means different connection IDs on
   different paths may have the same sequence number value.

   Retire Prior To:  A variable-length integer indicating which
      connection IDs should be retired on the path specified by Path
      Identifier; see Section 4.3.3.

   Length: An 8-bit unsigned integer containing the length of the
   connection ID.  Values less than 1 and greater than 20 are invalid
   and MUST be treated as a connection error of type
   FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.

   Connection ID: A connection ID of the specified length.

   Stateless Reset Token: A 128-bit value that will be used for a
   stateless reset when the associated connection ID is used.

   The Sequence Number field and Retire Prior To field is allocated for
   each path independently.  The Retire Prior To field indicates which
   connection IDs should be retired on the corresponding path of Path
   Identifier.

   The Retire Prior To field applies to connection IDs established
   during connection setup if the Path Identifier is 0 indicating the
   initial path; see Section 4.3.3.  The value in the Retire Prior To
   field MUST be less than or equal to the value in the Sequence Number
   field.  Receiving a value in the Retire Prior To field that is
   greater than that in the Sequence Number field MUST be treated as a
   connection error of type FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.

   Length, Connection ID, Stateless Reset Token fields have exactly the
   same definition in NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame Section 19.15 of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   Note that connection IDs issued in NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames MUST be
   treated as their Path Identifier is 0.  Also the retire prior to
   field of NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames just effect the connection IDs of
   initial path with path ID 0.  This machanism is compatible with
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

8.6.  MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames

   An endpoint sends a MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame (type=0x15228c0a)
   instead of RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame to indicate that it will no
   longer use a connection ID that was issued by its peer.  This
   includes the connection ID provided during the handshake.  Sending a
   MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame also serves as a request to the peer to
   send additional connection IDs for future use, unless the path
   specified by Path Identifier has been abandoned.  New connection IDs
   can be delivered to a peer using the MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame
   (Section 8.5).

   Retiring a connection ID invalidates the stateless reset token
   associated with that connection ID.

   MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames are formatted as shown in Figure 10.

   MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID Frame {
     Type (i) = 0x15228c0a,
     Path Identifier (i),
     Sequence Number (i),
   }

              Figure 10: MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID Frame Format

   Path Identifier:  A path identifier which is pre allocated when the
      connection ID is generated, which means the current connection ID
      can only be used on the corresponding path.

   Sequence Number: The sequence number assigned to the connection ID by
   the sender on the path specified by Path Identifier, encoded as a
   variable-length integer.

8.7.  MAX_PATHS frames

   A MAX_PATHS frame (type=0x15228c0b) informs the peer of the
   cumulative number of paths it is permitted to open.

   MAX_PATHS frames are formatted as shown in Figure 11.

   MAX_PATHS Frame {
     Type (i) = 0x15228c0b,
     Maximum Paths (i),
   }

                     Figure 11: MAX_PATHS Frame Format

   MAX_PATHS frames contain the following field:

   Maximum Path Identifier:  A count of the cumulative number of path
      that can be opened over the lifetime of the connection.  This
      value cannot exceed 2^32-1, as it is not possible to encode Path
      IDs larger than 2^32-1.  Receipt of a frame that permits opening
      of a path with Path Identifier larger than this limit MUST be
      treated as a connection error of type FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.

   Loss or reordering can cause an endpoint to receive a MAX_PATHS frame
   with a lower path limit than was previously received.  MAX_PATHS
   frames that do not increase the path limit MUST be ignored.

   An endpoint MUST NOT initiate a path with a path ID higher than the
   Maximum Paths value.  An endpoint MUST terminate the a connection
   with an error of type MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION if a peer opens more
   paths than was permitted.

9.  Error Codes

   Multipath QUIC transport error codes are 62-bit unsigned integers
   following [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   This section lists the defined multipath QUIC transport error codes
   that can be used in a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with a type of 0x1c.
   These errors apply to the entire connection.

   MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION (experiments use 0x1001d76d3ded42f3): An
   endpoint detected an error with protocol compliance that was not
   covered by more specific error codes.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new transport parameter for the negotiation
   of enable multiple paths for QUIC, and three new frame types.  The
   draft defines provisional values for experiments, but we expect IANA
   to allocate short values if the draft is approved.

   The following entry in Table 2 should be added to the "QUIC Transport
   Parameters" registry under the "QUIC Protocol" heading.
