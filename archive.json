I think we might also want to add a sentence in the Sec. of \"one packet number space\" explicitly specifying that \"for single PN, use ACK instead of ACK_MP\", and change some texts in the ACK_MP frame section that is related to zero-length CID (the current draft says \"if the endpoint receives 1-RTT packets with 0-length Connection ID, it SHOULD use Packet Number Space Identifier 0 in ACK_MP frames\". ).\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Do we really need to send \"abandon path\" in both directions?

How does the server know whether it should create a new path or not?\r\n\r\nI think in single PN, sending \"abandon path\" in both directions is helpful. When the client sends \"PATH_ABANDON\", it promises not to send non-probing packets in the current activity cycle. It could send probing packets to reactivate the path a moment later if the client thinks the network environment has changed. After sending out \"PATH_ABANDON\", the client should still be able to receive packets from the server for a while on that path because there may be the server's inflight packets on that path. It was not until the client sees the server's \"PATH_ABANDON\", the client then knows that no more server's data is to be expected except for some out-of-order packets. So after receiving \"PATH_ABANDON\", the endpoint can start preparing to free memories and clear path stats allocated for that path. The time interval from seeing \"PATH_ABANDON\" to actually releasing relevant resources is going to be an important parameter, and yes, 10-30 seconds is too long. What would be a more appropriate number for this interval? \r\n\r\n> \r\n> In the single space case, the logical test may be to check the sequence numbers of the packet. If the sequence number of the new packet is greater than that of the path_abandon, then the client is reactivating a path that was abandoned previously. Maybe the client connected again to the same network, after some disconnected interval. The server can start sending on the reactivated path. If the packet number is lower than that of the path abandon, then the server should not reactivate the path.\r\n\r\nDoes it imply that we need to track the packet number of the PATH_ABANDON for a path that is closed? When a path is in a closed state, the server may reject any newly received packets unless it is a probing packet (back to our path initialization process). In this way, it should be OK to forget any info related to that path in the last activity cycle.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> In the multiple space case, if the CID is defined, there is no ambiguity.\r\n\r\n",

As the problem is similar to FIN-ACK&FIN-ACK when TCP closes, I kept the ACK in the graph (because the path_id_type=2 refers to the path where the packet is traveling, we want to make sure it is acked before we close the path.). Regarding the resource, I think if we keep a unified receive record, which is not per-path, yes, we can discard the sending resources. But if we have some path stats (e.g. how many packets received in total in this current activity cycle), we need to keep these data structures until we are sure that the peer is not going to send more packets on that path. Indeed, it depends on the implementation, but I feel it is generally helpful to have PATH_ABANDON sent in both directions.

This is basically the same issue as determining whether a connection is broken, just applied to a path. But that is not entirely sufficient, because the server needs to also infer whether the client still wants to use that path.\r\n\r\nThe monitoring of non probing packets is just an heuristic. The server observes that if the client is not using the path, and deduces that it should not be using it itself. That's not a bad heuristic, but it requires the client to send some kinds of \"keep alive\" if it wants the server to continue using a path. We may debate how often that should happen. Maybe reuse the same timeout as for jettisoning paths.\r\n\r\nAnother solution may be for the client to tell something like \"please don't use that path anymore\", but that requires adding a new frame as part of the core multipath specification. In draft-liu, this was done with a specialization of the \"path status\", setting the status to \"Abandon\". Maybe we should just use a simplified for of the PATH_STATUS, leaving out the complexities of managing priorities for the advanced scheduling drafts:\r\n```\r\nABANDON_PATH Frame {\r\n  Type (i) = TBD,\r\n  Path_identifier (i),\r\n  Error Code (i),\r\n  Reason Phrase Length (i),\r\n  Reason Phrase (..),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

However if we think one packet number space is mandatory to implement, it would make more sense to have it the other way around and allow fallback to one packet number space, namely if the client ask for two packet number spaces but the server supports only one but would also lead to a successful negotiation.\r\n\r\nWhat do people think about this?",

The first thing is to allow people more freedom. If some implementors only want to use one option, they just need to implement one code branch.  Second, single packet number space requires the modification of loss detection algorithm, the way how rtt is sampled (the overall largest ack may not be the largest acked packet on a given path), and some delayed ACK strategies, which might take additional effort. People may also want to avoid round-robin scheduling in single PN as it creates a lot of holes in the ack range, so certain things regarding performance get coupled. Christian introduced many good practices and we are currently learning from it, so we probably need more experience on that.  ",

To avoid failure for interop tests, I suggest that we could negotiate the transport parameter like this: use 2-bits in the value field for negotiating one or more PN spaces.\r\n\r\n- 0x0: don't support multi-path\r\n- 0x1: only support multiple PN spaces for multi-path\r\n- 0x2: only support one PN space for multi-path\r\n- 0x3: support both one PN space and multiple PN space \r\n\r\nThe client could send all these 4 values in the enable_multipath transport parameter which depends on what kind of modes it supports. If the server just support one mode(such as one PN space), it could return 0x2 so that the client knows how to do next. If the server support both, it could choose 0x1 or 0x2 as it prefers, and make sure that the server don't return 0x3 as it need to decide which mode to choose. In 0x2 mode, the endpoints must not use 0-length CID.\r\n\r\nThen for people who just want one PN space, it would be ok to just support 0x2 mode. For the other guys who don't use 0-length Connection ID and want to get less overhead for ack ranges, they could choose to use 0x1 mode. And for people who want to support both 0-length CID and multiple PN spaces, they could choose 0x3 and of course it will add more modification in the implementation.\r\nMaybe this could meet everyone's need for experiments. \r\n\r\n",

If this info is not available, the sender has to base its decision on other (local known) criteria. \r\n\r\n> does the status change if the peer starts sending non-probing frames on the path?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n> can both client and server change the status of a path?\r\n\r\nYes and no. The status tells the other end if or if not it should send data on the path. So effectively it impacts only one direction of the path as the other direction is a local decision.\r\n\r\n> do frames affect both directions of a path?\r\n\r\nNo. As I just said. This is a recommendation for the sender, however, if the sender follows that recommendation is effectively also a local decision.\r\n\r\nAgain, I think we should at this point really just focus on the standby function and not make this too generic because that makes is more complicated.",

Additionally, since multi-path would be a negotiated feature/extension, that would mean all connections that don't negotiate the feature would have the \"old\" model/logic, where as the connections that do would have the new encryption/decryption logic.

I've also read through the draft itself and I think it's in a good place to support the current QUIC offload design without requiring any hardware changes. This is good.\r\n> \r\n> First thing to address is the tweaks to the AEAD nonce generation required for multipath. As we know, the non-multipath nonce generation has the hardware XOR'ing the 12B IV with the 62b pkt_num (which is left padded with zeros to 12B). For multipath, the nonce must be tweaked even more to ensure a unique nonce is always used for any multipath packet using the same key. The solution in the current draft rolls in the destination connID sequence number. This makes sense. In order to not change the hardware and still support multipath, the QUIC kernel module and/or driver must XOR in the destination connID sequence number to the IV. The result is the IV that is offloaded for the flow to the hardware. The hardware continues to do the same nonce generation with this IV XOR'ed with the pkt_num. \r\n> \r\n> Example from the multipath draft RFC:\r\n> IV: 0x6b26114b9cba2b63a9e8dd4f\r\n> Connection ID Sequence Number: 0x3\r\n> Packet Number = 0xaead\r\n> Nonce = (IV XOR ((connid_seq_num << 64) | pkt_num))\r\n> ((0x3 << 64) | 0xaead) = 0x00000003000000000000aead\r\n>     0x6b26114b9cba2b63a9e8dd4f (IV)\r\n> XOR 0x00000003000000000000aead ((connid_seq_num << 64) | pkt_num)\r\n>     --------------------------\r\n>     0x6b2611489cba2b63a9e873e2\r\n> \r\n> Same method supporting existing offload mechanism:\r\n> IV: 0x6b26114b9cba2b63a9e8dd4f\r\n> Connection ID Sequence Number: 0x3\r\n> Packet Number = 0xaead\r\n> New IV passed in flow offload = (IV XOR (connid_seq_num << 64))\r\n>     0x6b26114b9cba2b63a9e8dd4f (IV)\r\n> XOR 0x000000030000000000000000 (connid_seq_num << 64)\r\n>     --------------------------\r\n>     0x6b2611489cba2b63a9e8dd4f\r\n> Nonce (hardware): (IV XOR pkt_num)\r\n>     0x6b2611489cba2b63a9e8dd4f (offloaded IV)\r\n> XOR 0x00000000000000000000aead (pkt_num)\r\n>     --------------------------\r\n>     0x6b2611489cba2b63a9e873e2\r\n> \r\n> Second thing is whether or not the destination connID sequence number is used in the nonce or a new path identifier. From a hardware perspective it doesn't matter. The nonce construction would be the same as I detailed above with the driver XOR'ing in the connid_seq_num or the path_id into the IV before offloading the flow. There is an implication though, as you mentioned, if the destination connID sequence number is used, the IV in the offloaded flow will change. To support this, the offloaded flow would have to be deleted from the hardware and then re-offloaded with the updated IV. Alternatively, if a unique path identifier is used, the flow would never need to be removed and re-offloaded again.\r\n> \r\n> My vote is to move the multipath design to support a unique path identifier as it's cleaner. But as you can see, it's not required from a hardware perspective. Another thing to note, the connID is part of the flow lookup on the Rx side. Simple hardware implementations would require the flow to be removed and re-offloaded with a connID change. As we've discussed with numerous customers, this is acceptable.\r\n> \r\n> Feel free to copy these ideas into this GitHub issue for further discussion: https://github.com/quicwg/multipath/issues/25\r\n> \r\n> If you haven't seen it, we also presented QUIC offload at the last OCP Summit. This presentation complements that one Andy gave at Linux Plumbers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAvQhJSm6O8\r\n> \r\n> It's important to keep the hardware offload design as simple as possible. I don't see any need to make changes to the current offload design in order to support multipath. Let us know if you need any help with specifics going into the next IETF wg meeting. :-)\r\n> \r\n> Thanks,\r\n> - e",

With non-zero-length Connection IDs at both ends, it is indeed possible that over a same path/5-tuple, the client reaches the server using a DCID with a sequence number that is different from the sequence number of the DCID used by the server to reach the client (e.g., Figure 2). In the current draft, we consider that if the connection ID is zero-length, the packet number space identifier is 0, and applying multiple packet number spaces is thus not possible.\r\n\r\nI believe we can do better than this. Consider the situation where the client uses a non-zero length DCID to reach the server while the server uses zero-length DCID. In this case, it is the client that initiates the usage of a path with path validation, associating a server-provided non-zero-length DCID to reach the server. Once the first client's packet reaches the server on the new path, the server can associate the client's 5-tuple to the sequence number of the used Destination Connection ID, making a valid Packet Number Space Identifier. The client can easily map incoming packets on the 5-tuple to the associated DCID sequence number.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound reasonable?",

It may also want to keep some context to process acknowledgement of packets previously sent on that path. The general guidance is to to wait for something like 3xRTO before dropping path management resource.\r\n\r\nI don't think that we need symmetry, that both peers have to abandon the path before they can release resource. But we have to solve a potential path suicide problem. Suppose we have two paths, peer 1 abandons path #1, peer 2 abandon path #2. Now we have zero path, and the connection is closed -- unless the client promptly opens a new path #3. My original intention is that only the client ever sends an ABANDON_PATH, since only the client can initiate a new path, which dodges the path suicide issue. ",

For me, the issue is that when an endpoint decides to close a path, it is probably due to that the path condition is getting worse, which also means that further communication on that path may fail. When we use non-zero CID, as we should have at least one path that is working (if no path is working, the connection will be closed), and we are not constraint to send PATH_ABANDON frame on the same path that we want to close, the sender should be able to receive the ACK of PATH_ABANDON. But when we use null CID, we use path_id_type 0x02, which refers to the path where the packet is coming from, and hence, we are constraint to send PATH_ABANDON on the same path we want to close. In such a case, it is likely that the ACK of PATH_ABANDON will not be received, resulting in the \"half-open\" problem. Therefore, we should say sth like \"when the sender moves into the \"ABANDON_SENT\" state, and after 3RTO, it should close the path even if it hasn't seen the PATH_ABANDON sent from its peer\". \r\n",

The receiver-side resources are released when the RETIRE_CID frame is received.

In\r\nthis case, QUIC must select the path over which each frame will be sent. Many PS strategies\r\nare possible and the best one will depend on the application's requirements. The PS should\r\nhave access to (an abstraction of) the congestion control state of each path to be able to determine\r\nwhether a path has enough capacity to carry a new packet. The PS also needs to have access to the\r\npath's MTU as different paths do not necessarily have the same MTU. A simple PS is a round-robin\r\nscheduler that checks the congestion window of a path before sending a QUIC packet.\r\nAnother sample PS is an algorithm that selects the path whose congestion window is open and\r\nthat has the smallest round-trip-time. This is the PS used by the Linux implementation of Multipath\r\nTCP. Note that a multipath QUIC PS will probably treat control and data packets differently. For\r\nexample, a PS could favor low delay paths to send acknowledgments and higher bandwidth\r\nones for data packets. A companion draft\r\n{{I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers}} provides several general-purpose multipath\r\npacket schedulers. \r\n```",

However, from the standpoint of security, there is no need to have \"probing\" state that forbids an endpoint from sending most types of frames.\r\n\r\nIIRC, the only reason we have the distinction of probing packets and non-probing packets in QUIC v1 is because QUIC v1 has only one loss recovery and congestion controller. As there is one, a QUIC v1 endpoint has to send signal that indicates to peer the change of the active path (i.e., the path that uses loss recovery and congestion controller) - that is what non-probing packets are used for.\r\n\r\nWith Multipath QUIC, we have per-path loss recovery and congestion control.

In order to close an idle path more precisely, one might need sth like max_path_idle_timeout. I think we want all paths to have the same max_path_idle_timeout values, which is used to control when a path should be closed when no non-probing packets was received on that path. Another approach is to use PING frame to keep a path alive. ",

Or, we see what Ali Baba has done for video download, using redundant transmission on multiple paths to minimize buffering of videos.

Stopping ack'ing packets to stop someone sending on a path is wrong and is something you should never do. If you receive a packet successfully you should ack it (also because that would otherwise confuse congestion control). But we have the abandon frame exactly for that case.\r\n\r\nHowever, it also seems wrong to me to require sending acks on the same path taen the data is received. So if you decide to always only send ack on one path and all payload data flows into one direction only over multiple paths, the current text would require you to send potentially unnecessary ping packets over each non-ack'ing paths or you would end up closing those paths which also is wrong as everything seems to work fine.\r\n\r\nSo the question is really is, do we want to require pings in this scenario (payload traffic over multiple paths but acks only on one path) in order to ensure that all paths are usable bidirectionally? I think that's unnecessary overhead and believe Olivier's proposed addition is the correct thing to do.",

A client constructs packets using any previously unused active connection ID, taken from either the \r\n  preferred_address transport parameter or a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame.\r\n\r\n  As soon as path validation succeeds, the client SHOULD begin sending all future packets to the new server address using the \r\n  new connection ID and discontinue use of the old server address.

One number space per path should be more efficient, because implementations can directly reuse the loss-recovery logic specified for QUIC\r\n* ACK size. Single space leads to lots of out of order delivery, which causes ACK sizes to grow\r\n* Simplicity of code. Single space can be implemented without adding mane new code paths to uni-path QUIC\r\n* Shorter header. Single space works well with NULL length CID\r\n\r\nThe picoquic implementation shows that \"efficiency\" and \"ack size\" issues of single space implementations can be mitigated. However, that required significant improvements in the code:\r\n\r\n* to obtain good loss efficiency, picoquic remembers not just the path on which a packet was sent, but also the order of the packet on this path, i.e. a \"virtual sequence number\". The loss detection logic then operates on that virtual sequence number.\r\n\r\n* to contain ACK size, picoquic implements a prioritization logic to select the most important ranges in an ACK, avoid acking the same range more than 3 or 4 times, and keep knowledge of already acknowledged ranges so range coalescing works.\r\n\r\nI think these improvements are good in general, and I will keep them in the implementations whether we go for single space or not. The virtual sequence number is for example useful if the CID changes for reasons not related to path changes in multiple number space variants. It is also useful in unipath variants to avoid interference between sequence numbers used in probes and the RACK logic. The ACK size improvements do reduce the size of ACKs in presence of out of order delivery, e.g., if the network is doing some kind of internal load balancing. On the other hand, the improvements are somewhat complex, would need to be described in separate drafts, and pretty much contradicts the \"simplicity of code\" argument.\r\n\r\nSo we are left with the \"Null length CID\" issue. I see for cases:\r\n\r\nClient CID | Sender CID | Support | Priority\r\n-----------|------------|-----------|------------\r\nlong | long | Supported in both variants | Used by many implementations\r\nNULL | long | Requires special support in multiple spaces case, but could work | Preferred configuration of many big deployments\r\nlong | NULL | Requires special support in multiple spaces case, but could work | Rarely used, server load balancing does not work\r\nNULL | NULL | Does not work for multiple spaces | Only mentioned in some P2P deployments\r\n\r\nThe point here is that it is somewhat hard to deploy a large server with NULL CID and use server load balancing. This configuration is mostly favored by planned P2P deployments.",

The previous dilemma for me was that on one hand we have some use cases where we need to support more than two paths and separate PN makes the job easier, but on the other hand, I think we should not ignore the NULL CID use cases as it is also important. Now, with this proposal, a big part of the problem is solved. The rest of challenge is to make sure single PN remains efficient in terms of ACK and loss recovery. On that part, we plan to do an A/B test and would love to share the results when we get them.\r\n\r\nThere is one more problem as pointed in issue #25 , when we want to take hardware offloads into account. In such a case, we may still need single PN for long server CID.  However, if hardware supports nonce modification, this problem can be addressed with the proposed \"unified solution\".",

Use of a single packet number space might not support ECN.\r\n\r\nRegarding the unified solution: I think what you actually say is that we would specify both solutions and everybody would need to implement both logics. At least regarding the \"simplicity of code\" argument, that would be the worst choice.\r\n\r\nIf we can make the multiple packet number spaces solution work with one-sided CIDs, I'm tending toward such an approach. Use of multiple packet number spaces avoids ambiguity/needed \"smartness\" in ACK handling and packet scheduling which, as you say above, can make the implementation more complex and, moreover,  wrong decisions may have large impact on efficient (both local processing and on-the-wire). I don't think we want to leave these things to each implementation individually.",

Besides ECN, my other concern about single packet number is that it require cleverness from the receiver side if you want to be performant in some scenarios. At the sender-side, you need to consider a path-relative packet number threshold instead of an absolute one to avoid spurious losses.\r\n\r\nJust a point I think we did not mentioned yet is that there can be some interactions between Multipath out-of-order number delivery and incoming packet number duplicate detection. This requires maintaining some state at the receiver side, as described by https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#section-12.3-12. With single packet number space, the receiver should take extra care when updating the \"minimum packet number below which all packets are immediately dropped\". Otherwise, in presence of paths with very different latencies, the receiver might end up discarding packets from a (slower) path.\r\n\r\nI'm also preferring the multiple packet number spaces solution for the above reasons. I'm not against thinking for a \"unified\" solution (the proposal sounds interesting), but I wonder how much complexity this would add compared to requiring end hosts to use one-byte CIDs.",

Nodes that rely on multipath just use long CID and one number space per CID.\r\n* Nodes that use long CID never have to implement the ACK length minimization algorithms.\r\n* Nodes that see a peer using NULL CID have a variety of implementation choices, e.g., sending on just one path at a time, sending on mostly one path at a time in \"make or break\" transitions, or implementing sophisticated algorithms.\r\n\r\nIf we do that, we can get rid of the single vs multiple space discussion, and end up with a single solution addressing all use cases.",

If the connection ID was used by the peer to identify a path from the peer to this endpoint, the resources include the list of received packets used to send acknowledgements. The peer MAY decide to keep sending data using the same IP addresses and UDP ports previously associated with the connection ID, but MUST use a different connection ID when doing so.\r\n\r\n  So retiring associated CID only cause the resources belonging to the corresponding packet number space to be released, but not the whole path to be closed. In CID migration cases, endpoints just want to retire the old CID and use a new one, as path is defined as \"refers to the 4-tuple\"  in the current draft, this operation will not cause the whole path context (including congestion control states, RTT measurements, etc.) to be removed.\r\n\r\n2. Path closing is triggered by PATH_ABANDONED frame, and does not have dependency on CID retiring (Although path closing would trigger the retirement of CID resource). So when path_state transmit from \"Closing\" to \"Closed\", the proper condition might be \"Acknowledgement of PATH_ABANDONED frame received\" or \"Path's draining timeout for at least 3 times the current PTO interval\".\r\n",

          "body": "First, regarding the transitioning from a \"closing\" state to a \"closed\" state, there will be a problem if we use the receipt of the ACK of a PATH_ABANDON as a condition for the transitioning due to possible out-of-order delivery. Suppose a client uses DCID S2 to on its first path to send three pkts with the packet number 100, 101, and 102, where PATH_ABANDON frame is sent in packet 102. However, due to the out-of-order delivery, it is possible that 102 is acked first, while packet 100 and 101 are still in flight. Therefore, at this point, we cannot mark the first path as \"closed\" since it is also possible that the acks of those two packets will later return from the first path. Due to the above reasons, in the initial design, we say that the path should be closed after CIDs are retired. As shown in the path-closing figure (Fig.3) in the draft, after the client makes sure that the packets (100, 101) sent before PATH_ABANDON on path 1 are also acknowledged, it then decides that the CID S2 is no longer needed, and thus sending out the RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame.\r\n\r\nSecond, regarding the transitioning from an \"active\" state to a \"closed\" state, yes, it is possible that we want to retire the old CID and use a new one, and I think the current figure is a bit confusing.  The purpose of this transitioning is to handle exceptions and it basically says that when there are no available CIDs to use for communication on a particular path, we should close it. I think we can simply keep the \"path's timeout\" as the condition because when there are no available CIDs, the path timeout will be triggered anyway.",

We could instead have an intermediate \"Idle\" state in which as long as you have no associated CID, keep relevant recovery/RTT/... contexts.\r\n\r\nIn general, I think it could be worthwhile to make a clearer distinction between the acknowledgment/packet number context and the recovery one. For instance, if for any reason a host changes the DCID used over a given path, it should still keeps track of packets sent with the previous DCID (and thus possibly sent with a different packet number space).\r\n\r\nFor the \"Closing\" to \"Closed\" transition, I tend to agree with Yunfei and I would not directly rely on the acknowledgment of the PATH_ABANDON frame to close my path. But as a sender, I can react to the acknowledgment of my PATH_ABANDON frame and send the RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame. On the other hand, relying on 3*PTO to transition from \"Closing\" to \"Closed\" is probably more relevant than using the path's idle timeout.",

So we are pretty much left to peer to peer scenarios, in which the server is a single computer.

Imagine a node with a hard limit to maximum two simultaneous paths per connection, but advertising 3 CIDs. With RFC 9000 the only option would be to ignore incoming challenges for new paths. The peer will see timeouts, and repeat the challenges a number of time before giving up.

For example, one of the current paths may have been abandoned, and the peer does not know that yet. So if we create a \"max path\" mechanism, we also need some kind of synchronization mechanism. Or, we could add a soft-error mechanism of some kind, something like a \"CHALLENGE_REFUSED\" frame, maybe carrying an error reason.

However, there is still sth that is not quite clear to me. You mentioned Kalman filter. My understanding is that your state vector is the one-way-delay for each path in each direction. For example, if I have N paths, then I could write down s=[OWD_inbound_1, ...., OWD_inbound_N, OWD_outbound_1,... OWD_outbound_N]. For the process equation, we can write s_(k+1) = s_k + w_k, where w_k is the process noise/disturbance. The difficult part in the problem is that in the observation equation H is a random matrix, which means in each measurement y, y could be the combination of two one-way delays that the combination could change each time. So to me,  at the first glance, the problem is a bit different from the Kalman's formulation whose observation is y = H*s + v, where v is the noise term and H is fixed. I think this is not that relevant, but I am really curious to learn the technique. ",

That would be a bit too CPU intensive.

When using Identifier Type 0, the Path Identifier corresponds to the sequence number of the Source CID of the sender, hence the sequence number of the Destination CID used by the receiver to send packets on the related path.\r\n\r\nWhile there are obvious values that could be considered as bad and may lead to, e.g., a MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION (e.g., a sequence number larger than any sequence number advertised), I don't think we should be as radical with regular values as they might have been retired meanwhile (also possible to face this with packet reordering). The worst edge cases I see are the followings.\r\n\r\nWith type 1, the sender might send a PATH_ABANDON with the seq of the CID in one packet, and then the RETIRE_CID retiring that CID in a subsequent one, but the RETIRE_CID reaches the receiver before the PATH_ABANDON one. If the receiver drops state upon RETIRE_CID reception, it won't be able to map the PATH_ABANDON to the path.\r\n\r\nWith type 0, the sender might send a PATH_ABANDON with the seq of the CID, but before it reaches the peer, the peer sends a RETIRE_CID retiring that CID. If the receiver drops the CID state upon RETIRE_CID sending, it won't be able to map the PATH_ABANDON to the path.\r\n\r\nHandling these edge cases with connection closure is clearly too strong. Still, ignoring or even acknowledging these PATH_ABANDON may have bad consequences. Silently dropping packets (i.e., not acknowledge the packet having PATH_ABANDON) will make the peer retransmit the frame (hoping it updates its path identifier) but could cause the loss/non-acknowledgment of accompanying frames (e.g., STREAM ones), and processing packet content without acknowledging it sounds odd. Acknowledging PATH_ABANDON that cannot be mapped to a path would make some desynchronisation about the status of the path between the peers (the sender now assumes the path is closed, but the receiver not).\r\n\r\nTo address the type 1 issue, we could write some text stating that a sender cannot retire a DCID if a PATH_ABANDON containing the related sequence number is still in flight. But for the type 0, the fix is not obvious (I don't think we could have the same solution as in #135)...",

However, I think there is one point we need to address.\r\n\r\nThis is what RFC9000 says:\r\n\r\n> With this option, an endpoint could send a PING frame ([Section 19.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#frame-ping)) periodically, which will cause the peer to restart its idle timeout period. Sending a packet containing a PING frame restarts the idle timeout for this endpoint also if this is the first ack-eliciting packet sent since receiving a packet. Sending a PING frame causes the peer to respond with an acknowledgment, which also restarts the idle timeout for the endpoint.\r\n\r\nIf you send a PING only one path and don't get a response, you won't reset the timer and might close the connection even though another path might still be alive. I think that would be wrong.\r\n\r\nSo I think the two options are you either send PINGs on all paths; or you try one path first and if you don't get a reply, reset the timer and try the next one. ",

          "body": "@mirjak, you are describing the \"keep alive\" scenario. Yes, keep alive becomes a bit tricky in multipath, because the client may want to select how many paths it wants to keep alive, and which ones. For example, a client with Wi-Fi and cellular may want to keep the cellular path alive, because it will survive a mobility event. It may want to do that even if it is sending traffic over Wi-Fi. That's a local implementation decision. How they do that, however, is straightforward: send a Ping on the path that you want to keep alive.\r\n\r\nI think we should let implementers decide what they want to do. If we do add some text, is should be about keep alive, not about ping. Something like:\r\n```\r\n## Keep Alive\r\n\r\nThe QUIC specification defines an optional keep alive process, see {{Section 5.3 of RFC9000}}.\r\nImplementations of the multipath extension should consider whether this keep alive process\r\nshould be applied to at least one path, all the paths, no path, or a specific subset of the paths.\r\nDifferent applications will likely require different strategies. Once the implementation has\r\ndecided to keep a specific path alive, it can do so by sending Ping frames on that path before\r\nthe idle timeout expires.\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

I'm also not sure that an endhost is required to use available DCIDs \"in-sequence\" (i.e., it may use the CID with seq 2 before using the CID with seq 1).\r\n\r\nBasically, let's consider the following example. Assume a two path scenario where the client uses DCID seq 0 on a path A and DCID seq 2 on a path B. At some point (e.g., the server might notice a NAT rebinding on path B), the server would like the client to retire the DCID with seq 2. The only way the server could force this behaviour is to send NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames with Retire Prior To set to 3, which would force the client to send RETIRE_CID frames. However, doing so would also force the client to retire DCID seq 0, which might not be required/needed/wanted.\r\n\r\nFWIW, [one of the previous multipath proposals](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-deconinck-quic-multipath/07/) proposed to let the CID issuer split the CIDs into \"uniflow spaces\", i.e., pre-assign CIDs to specific paths. Such a design enables retiring a specific CID using the Retire Prior To without affecting the other paths, as the CID seq is path-specific. However, such a solution adds more complexity than the current draft, which is likely not desirable.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I'm not sure with the current proposal the aforementioned issue is a big one, but it would indeed deserve some documentation/discussion in the draft.",

If a CID is actually retired, there is not way to acknowledge the packets that were sent using that CID. Effectively, they are treated as lost.

This is not a huge constraint, but it is an exception to the proposed \"same path for ACK\" policy. But the main argument for that same path policy is about computing timers. That argument does not really apply when renewing the CID.\r\n\r\nSame issue for the path abandon. If packets are sent on the same four tuple with a new CID, just abandon that.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "In addition to the encryption consideration as mentioned above. I remember there was another reason why the sequence number of CID was chosen to identify a path. It brings us back to the definition of what is a path and what is a path identifier.\r\n\r\nBy definition of the draft and RFC9000, a path is defined by a 4-tuple {source IP address, source port number, destination IP address, destination port number}, and a path ID is an identifier used to identify a path. That means we need to construct a mapping between a path ID and the associated 4-tuple.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are couple of issues. First, the client's view and the server's view of the 4-tuple are not the same due to NAT.  Second, the 4-tuple can change due to (1) network path migration (think about the case where our phone's wifi is connected to a wifi router that has two outbound networks to the internet, one wireline and one satellite, and the router can switch between the two), and (2) NAT rebinding. If we use a constant path ID, then the path ID does not uniquely identify a 4-tuple, but instead, there will be a one-to-many mappings from a path ID to 4-tuples. \r\n\r\nIn #179, Quentin proposed to use entry point IDs to identify a path, I think this identification is stable in the case of NAT rebinding, where the 4-tuple changes but the physical path is actually unchanged. However, the problem is that when the underlying path has changed (in the above case, a router may switch packet from the wireline to the satellite to perform failover) while the entry point IDs on the end-hosts remain unchanged, then we end up using the same path identifier to identify different paths.\r\n\r\nThese problems can be solved when using QUIC's CID sequence number to identify a path. First, it allows the client and server to identify a path separately as they see different 4-tuples. Second, when 4-tuple changes, we eventually use new CIDs to communicate and thus, the mapping between a path ID and the 4-tuple remains as a one-to-one mapping. Third, we are logically correct in the case when the physical path indeed has migrated while the endhost interfaces are not changed.\r\n\r\n",

You have a code object holding the list of packets to acknowledge (receiver side), or an object containing the list of packets not acknowledged yet (sender side). These objects are tied to the connection ID. Nothing particularly complicated there: the sender knows exactly which connection ID it uses for a given packet; the receiver knows exactly what connection ID was carried in the packets that it received.\r\n\r\nThe issue that you mention comes from the ambiguity of \"Abandon Path\", \"Retire connection ID\", and \"retire previous connection ID\". We have to be clear about what that means:\r\n\r\n* Abandon Path means \"please do not send any more packets on that path\". No ambiguity there. It also implies: \"you can free the resource of that path at your convenience\". We need to specify how and when, there is some leeway.\r\n* Retire Connection ID\" means \"I have deleted all resource tied to the connection ID on my side\", which implies \"I will not use this connection ID to send any new packet\" and also \"I will not accept any new MP-ACK sent using the sequence number of that CID\".\r\n* \"retire previous CID\" means \"please retire these CID quickly\". RFC 9000 says \"The endpoint SHOULD continue to accept the previously issued connection IDs until they are retired by the peer\", so there is some leeway.\r\n\r\nSo I guess we have the following actions:\r\n\r\n* A node decides to stop using a CID, i.e., not send any more packet using that CID. The node can do that at any time on its own will, and SHOULD do that immediately after receiving an Abandon_Path frame, or after receiving a \"retire before\" indication.\r\n* The node should wait 3*RTO after that decision, so pending acknowledgements have enough time to arrive.\r\n* After 3*RTO, the node deletes the local resource, including the list of packets not acknowledged yet. Those packets should be considered lost.\r\n* The node then sends a Retire Connection ID frame.\r\n* The node receiving the Retire Connection ID frame deletes the resource associated with the CID, i.e., the list of packets to acknowledge. If the peer did wait long enough before sending Retire Connection ID frame, that list should be empty. If it is not, too bad, it can still be deleted, these packets will never be acknowledged, but the sender of the CID does not care.\r\n* After that, a node can still received an MP-ACK or an Abandon_Path mentioning an old CID, because we do have race conditions. Such frames should be silently ignored.\r\n\r\nDoes that remove the ambiguities? ",

Also, if the peer has no timing restrictions about when retiring a CID, this is fine as well.\r\n\r\nHowever, when receiving a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame with a \"Retire Prior To\" field forcing the receiver to remove DCIDs, RFC 9000 states that \"Upon receipt of an increased Retire Prior To field, the peer MUST stop using the corresponding connection IDs and retire them with RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames before adding the newly provided connection ID to the set of active connection IDs.\". Not sure the receiver of the NEW_CONNECTION_ID may delay the retirement of DCIDs for a long period. Once retired, the host cannot reference the paths identified by the retired CIDs in, i.e., PATH_ABANDON frames, which may be an issue if the peer does not provide enough new CIDs.\r\n\r\nBut the current path identification is fragile when one host (the client) changes the DCID used over a *same perceived* 4-tuple, but that the other (the server) *perceives a different* 4-tuple (typical case of NAT rebinding). The client will keep a single view of that path, but the server will have two different views having different 4-tuples and Path IDs for an actual same path, hence bringing path identification ambiguity here.\r\n\r\n@yfmascgy As long as the 4-tuple does not change, there is no \"path change\" from the QUIC viewpoint.

After the migration, the new packets sent by the client will be tied to the new CID on both sides -- see previous points about tying number space to connection IDs. There is no ambiguity about packet number space, packets will be correctly acknowledged, etc. The Abandon_Path or MP_ACK frames will not be ambiguous: they refer to the number space, not to the abstract concept of Path.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that the server will probably NOT treat the incoming packet with a new CID as a \"nat rebinding\". The algorithm pretty much defines NAT rebinding as \"same CID, different addresses or ports\". The conforming server will treat that as a new path, perform address validation, etc. If the server tries to use the old \"path\", the packets will be dropped by the NAT. The connection will recover eventually, but after some packet losses, and yes, that's not desirable.\r\n\r\nI think the simplest solution is for the client to somehow tell the server what it is doing. \"These packets carry CID sequence number 7.

A NAT rebinding mostly happens if a path is idle for some time, but that is already managed by the [4.3.4 in the current draft](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#name-idle-timeout):\r\n\r\n\"Hosts SHOULD stop sending traffic on a path if for at least the period of the idle timeout as specified in [Section 10.1.](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-10.1.) of [[QUIC-TRANSPORT](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#QUIC-TRANSPORT)] (a) no non-probing packet was received or (b) no non-probing packet sent over this path was acknowledged, but MAY ignore that rule if it would disqualify all available paths.\"\r\n\r\nIn other word, if a path is idle long enough such that the 4-tuple is changed by NAT, it should have already been closed except there is only one path left. Therefore, the chance that the server sees (1) >=2 active paths and (2) a packet that has a new CID and a new 4-tuple at the same time is low.\r\n\r\nWhen the server sees (1) >=2 active paths and (2)  a packet that has a new CID and a new 4-tuple, the issue is that we don't know which path the packet belongs to. Hence, we just treat it as an attempt for a new path as @mirjak suggested. However, in the current draft, when the client initiates a new path, the packet should contain a PATH_CHALLENGE frame (see [figure 2](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#name-path-establishment)). If the packet does not contain PATH_CHALLENGE, we should just ignore the packet, which eventually leads to path closure as specified by the current draft (see [figure 1](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#fig-path-states)). Note that in doing so, we are also resilient to the attacks mentioned by @qdeconinck that \"the client may frequently rotate the DCID it uses over a path for legitimate purposes, but an on-path attacker may tweak the 4-tuple, hoping it will make it create a lot of (invalid) paths' states at server side\". \r\n\r\nWhen the server sees (1) only 1 active path and (2) a packet of a new CID and a new 4-tuple but that packet does not have PATH_CHALLENGE, it knows which path the packet belongs to, and we just follow what single path QUIC does and the behavior of multipath quic and single path quic converge in this case.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think the current draft can already address the issue, and we probably just want to stick to what we have with some minor modifications.",

Yes, this should not happened that often, so dropping is not the worst option, however, I think having a stable path ID would also make the whole approach logically easier, but maybe that's something we need to discuss and agree on.\r\n\r\nNote that if we change the path ID, that automatically means that we have to silently ignore any unknown path ID as we never know for sure if it was an old path ID or really a completely invalid one. Otherwise we could create an error if we receive an invalid path ID. This could help to avoid that the end get out of sync.

Is there any good reason why we don't keep the Path ID constant over the life time of a path?\" \r\n\r\nI think we should just bite the bullet, and acknowledge that retiring a CID makes it unusable in the future -- MP frames mentioning the corresponding ID will just be silently ignored. Yes, this can cause for example some spurious packet loss detection, but that can be minimized with strict rules about when to retire a CID -- the various RTO guidelines that we discussed in other threads.

The fundamental issue is that in reality a path is only precisely defined by the sequence of every possible hops between two endpoints, but that can not be observed by the endpoint, so we have to use the 4-tuple definition of a path as a simplified and compromised notation that unfortunately does not capture the full picture. QUIC goes around this issue with the use of connection ID, so that we are not bothered by unstable path identifiers and can enable path migration. Therefore, I feel in multipath QUIC, we may want to inherit what QUICv1 does and reuse the CID mechanism to identify paths.",

      "body": "I think given the dynamic nature of the CID usage on paths that leads to some existing design issues(see #137, #158), it is worth having some stable path identification (to address, e.g., #169).\r\n\r\n# What does not change\r\n\r\nI think we now agree that a Multipath QUIC connection uses different Connection IDs on different paths, and each Connection ID has its own packet number space. Such a design enables end-hosts to easily receive packets and decrypt them without assuming anything about the network path (relying directly on the perceived 4-tuple makes the approach fragile). Note that we keep the ACK_MP as it (i.e., we acknowledge packet numbers that used a specific DCID).\r\n\r\n# Identifying network paths (until now)\r\n\r\nSo far, end hosts directly maps the (Destination) Connection ID sequence number as the path identifier of the network path. This path identifier is then used in the path-specific frames (PATH_ABANDON, PATH_STATUS,\u2026). Such an approach has the advantage that we do not have to define additional signalling to identify a network path, and it is relatively easy to track that. However, this means that if one endhost changes the DCID it uses over a given path, this means its identifier changes. Having such dynamic changing identifiers for a stable path causes design issues when using an identifier no more valid in the path-specific frames.\r\n\r\n# Proposal: explicit path identification advertisement during path validation\r\n\r\nThe path validation process establish the identification of a path through the advertisement of the \u201cEntry Point ID\u201d (EPID) used by the packet sender. Each path is identified by a tuple (local EPID, peer EPID). This identification is then used in the path-specific frames to identify the concerned path. Note that each endhost uses EPID 0 on the initial path.\r\n\r\nThis implies that we need an augmented version of the PATH_CHALLENGE/PATH_RESPONSE frames (let\u2019s say PATH_CHALLENGE_MP/PATH_REPSONSE_MP) that include the EPID that the sender used to send the frame.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s consider this initial situation.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  DCID 0 EPID 0                   DCID 0 EPID 0\r\n   +------------------------------------+\r\n   |                                    |\r\nClient                               Server\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this initial state, each endhost has one path:\r\n\r\nClient\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n\r\nFrom the server perspective, we have\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n\r\nNow the client wants to create a new path on a new local address, but still on the same server address (same IP and port at server side). When the server just processed the PATH_CHALLENGE_MP(data, EPID=1) sent by the client with DCID seq 1, we have this state:\r\n\r\nClient\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 1, ???) using DCID seq 1\r\n\r\nServer\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 1) using SCID seq 1\r\n\r\nNote that the server can figure out at packet reception on which local address it saw, and thus map the corresponding local EPID to the new seen path. The server can then replies with a PATH_RESPONSE_MP(data, EPID=0) (and also initiates a PATH_CHALLENGE_MP as well). Assume here it uses the DCID with seq 2. Once the PATH_RESPONSE_MP is received by the client, we have this state.\r\n\r\nClient\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 1, EPID 0) using DCID seq 1 and SCID seq 2\r\n\r\nServer\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 1) using SCID seq 1 and DCID seq 2\r\n\r\nNow the client can refer to the lower path in PATH_STATUS/PATH_ABANDON frame using (1, 0), and the server could use (1, 0). Note that it makes also possible to extend these frames to the set of paths sharing a given EPID. This tuple is stable as long as end hosts do not change the EPID they use when performing further path validations.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  DCID 0 EPID 0                   DCID 0 EPID 0\r\n   +------------------------------------+\r\n   |                                    |\r\nClient                               Server\r\n   |                                    |\r\n   +------------------------------------+\r\n  DCID 1 EPID 1                   DCID 2 EPID 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsider now a specific edge case, that is also hard to handle with the current (CID identification) design: the client decides to change the DCID it uses (now seq 2) on its path (EPID 1, EPID 0), but the very first packet sent experiences a NAT rebinding, making the server see a new 4-tuple. The end hosts\u2019 states just after the server received that packet is\r\n\r\nClient:\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 1, EPID 0) using SCID seq 2 and DCID seq 2\r\n\r\nServer:\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 1) using SCID seq 1 and DCID seq 2\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID ???) using SCID seq 2\r\n\r\nTo address this new unknown path, the server will initiate path validation over that new path using a new DCID (let\u2019s say with seq 3), so it sends a MP_PATH_CHALLENGE(EPID=0) on the lower path. Once the packet reaches and after its processing, we have\r\n\r\nClient:\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 1, EPID 0) using SCID seq 3 and DCID seq 2\r\n\r\nServer:\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 1) using SCID seq 1 and DCID seq 2\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID ???) using SCID seq 2 and DCID seq 3\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, the client replies with a MP_PATH_RESPONSE on its perceived EPID (hence EPID 1) and the response can reach the server, which can then figure out that the path is actually the same as the previous one (it experienced involuntary 4-tuple change, this is not a new path). The final state is hence\r\n\r\nClient:\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 1, EPID 0) using SCID seq 3 and DCID seq 2\r\n\r\nServer:\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 1) using SCID seq 2 and DCID seq 3\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional remarks\r\n\r\nIntroducing such additional identifiers may require additional care to cope with EPID that change over a same address or to avoid a same EPID over multiple 4-tuples. I think we can require that new EPID values cannot decrease (monotonically increasing) and observing a same EPID coming from different addresses probably indicates that something is wrong there.\r\n\r\nWe can also extend the required state of a path to be \"Active\", i.e., we need to have both local and peer EPID of a path before considering it as active.\r\n\r\nHaving two endpoint-specific values instead of a single shared one (as suggested by #170) may be desirable to support the edge case mentioned above.",

The frame is sent by the initiating endpoint and includes relevant information (see below). When received by the peer, the peer responds with a `PATH_SETUP` frame in the opposite direction with reciprocal information (an alternative is to have a separate frame type for the path setup response).\r\n\r\nIf there is a worry that the protocol specifications will run out of single-byte (6-bit) frame types, the new frame type could be given a type number in the two-byte (14-bit) range since it will be sent very infrequently.\r\n\r\n# Frame content\r\n\r\n## Path identifier\r\n\r\nThere are good reasons for a stable path identifier (see #179). Having the same path identifier in both directions simplify both the implementations and things like correlating traces taken at the two endpoints (#170).\r\n\r\nThe unique identifier for the new path is selected by the endpoint that initiates the new path. To simplify path initiation also from the server, clients use even path identifiers and servers use odd path identifiers when they initiate new paths. Path identifiers are never reused.\r\n\r\n## Path status\r\n\r\nThe `PATH_STATUS` frame is used to set the status of an existing path (`available` or `standby`). The status of a new path should be signaled directly at path setup, otherwise the peer might start to use a new path that is intended to be `standby` before it gets the `PATH_STATUS` frame.\r\n\r\n## Path parameters\r\n\r\nSome parameters of a new path can be different from what was negotiated for the original path at connection setup. They are signaled in the `PATH_SETUP` frame.\r\n\r\nExamples of per-path parameters: `max_udp_payload_size`, `max_idle_timeout`, `max_ack_delay`.\r\n",

ACK/ACK_MP frames in multipath acknowledge packets using a specific DCID. The issue here is that there is a one-to-many relation between a 4-tuple and the Path ID (i.e., the sequence number of the DCID used). Relying on the 4-tuple to infer the DCID that may lead to acknowledgment ambiguities here.\r\n\r\nConsider for the example the case where a client decides to rotate the DCID it uses over a given path every 2 packets (we could also consider a timer-based change where the DCID change occurs in the middle of a sending burst). It then sends over that path DCID 1 PN 0, DCID 1 PN 1, DCID 2 PN 0 and DCID 2 PN 1. What should the server sends here? If it relies on the largest DCID sequence number seen, it may send ACK(0-1), but from the client perspective, such indication is unclear (especially if, e.g., one of the packets sent with DCID 1 has been lost).",

However, these events are likely very rare. They are probably also rather specific and therefore hard to detect in time with generic algorithms.\r\n\r\nA straight-forward implementation would just recognise the path-specific problems and quickly retransmit on some other path, possibly with some overhead because of redundant transmission. A simple implementation could also have *some* special-case code for path problems, the key point with this issue is that steady state transmission should be as similar to unipath QUIC as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to your case above, it looks a bit odd to be honest. Why would the \"sender\" retire the CID if there's a chance that it will receive more packets on that path? Isn't path closing supposed to happen in an ordered fashion with `PATH_ABANDON` frames and only after that is the CID retired?",

Resetting the packet number with a new CID makes decryption easier, however, after you have decrypted the packet you may still be able to assign to an existing path.\r\n\r\nActually it is not a problem neither for decryption nor for path assignment, if only the 4-tuple or the CID changes. The problem is that if the client changes the CID, it never can be sure if not also the 4-tuple changes (which can even be likely after an idea period). Therefore the client need to reset the packet number for easy decryption when it uses a new CID (this is deviation from RFC9000 - just to note but that's probably fine). However, to my understanding just changeing the CID and reseting the packet number without a change in 4-tuple doesn't necessarily mean that this will create a new path, e.g. the server doesn't have to start validation and you don't have to close the old path as it is the same. So while you need to update your mapping from CID to path ID, I don't think the path ID has to change. This is the discussion we should have in #169.",

          "body": "I started a PR for this issue. See #242. However this needs more discussion as there are multiple options which all my have some problems.\r\n\r\nOption 1) The current PR creates two new frames. The idea of this change was to make it easy to add potential new status value in future by simply adding a new frame. However, having separate frames means the frames may arrive in different orders. In PATH_STATUS we had a frame sequence number; but to guarantee order among frames, this would mean all \"path-status\" frames would need to share a seq number space. I don't think that would be a complicated solution to implement but it does not feel like a clean design to have these dependencies among frames.\r\n\r\nOption 2) We could have a one PATH_STANDBY frame which always contains a full list of all CID seq numbers that should have this state and as such any update would always replace the old state. That means we could signal multiple updates in one frame, which can beneficial e.g. if you change CIDs on all paths, and further we would not need the PATH_AVAILABLE frame at all. However, this only works with two path states and also not if we in future want to define another path status frame. However, are we sure we need different exclusive states? E.g. If you would later define a path priority, this information can be orthogonal to the standby information rather than replacing it.\r\n\r\nOption 3) Only allow sending of path status information on the same path that the updates applies to and use the packet number for ordering. However, this means you cannot \"assign\" status information to a CID before the CID is used which at least theoretically would be possible with the other solutions. However, maybe it's sufficient to ensure that if a new CID is used the respective path status frame is sent in the first packet with this new CID. Not sure how complicated that would be for some implementations. Also is using packet number for order a good choice? Might also be complicated for some implementations...?\r\n\r\nOr Option 4, I guess, is to keep the current PATH_STATUS frame (and find a different way to make it extensible or make any future extensive a full replacement).",

I do not think that there is additional complexity with sharing the sequence number with multiple frames that update path status. In my view, we are merely merging the Path Status field that exists today into the frame type.\r\n\r\nAs to option 2, people who want to update states of all paths at once can do that with option 1, by sending multiple frames covering all paths at once in a single packet. Therefore, option 1 is a superset of option 2.\r\n\r\nRe option 3, yeah it would be complicated for some QUIC stacks. IIUC, there are two types of stacks; when a packet is lost, some QUIC stacks regenerate frames. Other QUIC stacks remember what has been sent in the encoded form and simply retransmit them. For the latter, it is hard to exclude frames carrying old information upon retransmission.",

There are four options, all with some drawbacks:\r\n\r\n* server notices that there is no \"PATH_CHALLENGE\" in the packet, which means the client probably did not intend to create a new path. That may be a fine heuristic, but it does not tell the server which path was the old path. The server will have to do some guesswork, e.g., look for three-tuple matching (destination-IP, destination-port, source-IP), or for two-and-a-half-tuple matching (destination-IP, destination-port, prefix of source-IP). It would then do as suggested in \"NAT Rebinding\", i.e., challenge both paths and pick the one that responds.\r\n\r\n* client bundles a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID(old CID) with the first packet after the migration. This has a major drawback: it prevents the server from sending new acknowledgements for packets received on the old path.\r\n\r\n* client bundles a PATH_ABANDON(old CID, reason = CID RETIRED) with the first packet after the migration. This creates a possible confusion, because PATH_ABANDON normally means abandon the path, not abandon the CID. We could see implementation errors.\r\n\r\n* client bundles a newly defined ABANDON_CID(old CID) frame with the first packet after the migration. The server realize that the client was merely trying to rotate the CID but that a path rebinding happened, and avoids sending new packets on the old path. \r\n\r\nThe last option is the best: indicate clearly the client intent, avoid extra traffic, avoid potential side effects. But all bundling solution have the issue that this \"first packet\" may be lost, and that the net packet will be received without the bundled data. This is probably OK since we are trying to solve a performance issue: the old path will be abandoned eventually, after idle timeout or after receiving a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame. Or, if the first packet with the new CID does not include the ABANDON_CID frame, the server may fall back to the first option: notice that there is no path challenge, etc.",

This appears relevant for the reason in that A can't determine if this path change only results was the result of a basic NAT binding with a source port change from B's perspective. But, I think there are a couple of corner cases, like two layer NATs with some failover where the packet could actually exit through a different NAT closest to B than previous and more substantially be a different route.

First, as stated, this text is just implementation guidance: the second sentence in fact says that ACK_MP can be sent on any path, and that nodes MUST not treat receiving an ACK_MP on a \"different\" path as an error. If this is implementation guidance, the text should move from the normative section to the implementation guidance section.\r\n\r\nSecond, I believe the guidance is wrong. I understand that the \"same path\" practice makes path RTT computation easier, but that's only one aspect of the issue, IMHO not the most dominant aspect. In QUIC, most packet losses are detected by noticing that packets sent later on the path are already acknowledged, not by waiting on timers. Sending ACK_MP on a short path will enable faster detection of packet losses by acked number holes, while sending only on the \"same\" path only improve the computation of RTT, which may or may not improve timer-based recovery. So, this is a trade-off: more precise path-RTT computation versus shorter control loop. Such tradeoff belong to implementation guidance, not the normative part.\r\n\r\nAt some point, I contributed the algorithm used in Picoquic to derive path estimates through multi-dimensional statistical analysis. OK, I get the criticism that we should not require every implementer to have a PhD in applied maths. There are of course much simpler ways to do this. Suppose a packet is sent on path X and the ACK received on path Y. The RTT will be approximately 1/2 the RTT of path X plus 1/2 the RTT of path Y. If we assume that delay variations are dominated by effects on the send path, we can apply a simple transform:\r\n\r\n1- let S be an RTT sample with data transmission on path X and ack on path Y.\r\n2- assume that S = 1/2 RTT(X) + 1/2 RTT(Y)\r\n3- derive S' = 2*S - RTT(Y)\r\n4- consider S' as an approximation of a measurement of RTT(X)\r\n5- use S' to update the smoothed RTT of path X, the RTT deviation, and the PTO.\r\n\r\nWe can discuss whether step 3 should use the smoothed RTT observed on path Y or the min RTT. Using the min RTT is probably more robust. The key here is that we can update the PTO of the path using very simple math.\r\n\r\nBut we can also wonder whether this is even needed. The PTO triggers when there is suspicion that the last packets sent to a path were lost. Effectively, the PTO triggers when \"at this time, an ACK_MP should have been received\". If ACK_MP are usually sent on the shortest path, it seems fine to just use the observed ACK delay (S in the example above) to update the PTO. The PTO will reflect both the delays and the ACK_MP sending strategy of the peer, and will fire exactly when the ACK_MP of the peer should most probably have been received.\r\n\r\nAnd of course the value could end up being wrong -- but that's not a new issue. The statistical model behind the PTO computation in RFC 9002 is an approximation (see \"no PhD\" comment), and that too is wrong some of the time. That's why RFC 9002 specifies doubling the PTO delay after each trial, and also not changing congestion parameter simply because of a first PTO expiration.\r\n\r\nBottom line: mandating ACK_MP on the same path is a tradeoff between ease of path RTT computation and efficiency of loss recovery. It should not be mandated. If we want to provide guidance, that should be in the implementation section.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Changes in path characteristics do happen, so both PTO and congestion controllers should be designed to adapt to changes in strategy, but when those occur there's an increased chance of spurious or delayed PTOs as well as over or under-sending data into the network.\r\n\r\nACKs do not need to be sent on the same path they were received upon to provide a stable RTT and representative RTTVar, but the strategy should be stable when possible.  For example, even alternating paths on every ACK produces RTT and RTTVar values that should not cause spurious PTOs, because the RTT will be the mean RTT and the farther apart the RTTs are, the larger the RTTVar will be.\r\n\r\nLooking at RFC9002, there are a number of normative statements about RTT calculation, and some of those were added to minimize the possibility of spurious PTOs, but there's nothing that parallels this I can find, so I could go either way on normative text.\r\n\r\nOne reason to send an ACK on the same path that data is received upon is to ensure network devices (ie: NATs, etc) keep the path open.  Sending in one direction on a path risks having the path get blackholed.",

In general, acking through the \"shortest\" path results in shorter RTT, and thus more efficient loss recovery and congestion control.

Quoting from [section 9.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#name-privacy-implications-of-con), _an endpoint MUST NOT reuse a connection ID when sending from more than one local address_, and _an endpoint MUST NOT reuse a connection ID when sending to more than one destination address_.

So I guess you should check that parameter at least against the number of already open paths.\r\n\r\nYeah, availability of spare Connection IDs limits the number of paths that can be opened, while `active_connection_id_limit` gives endpoints the expectation. I think the discussion of the expectation is covered by #221?\r\n\r\n> And finally an endpoint might also check the number of active paths again the number of active CID it provided to the peer.

Further, an endpoint MUST NOT initiate a subsequent key update until a packet with the current key has been acknowledged on each path\r\n\r\nThis has a multitude of problems:\r\n1. Depending on the number of paths, this is wasteful.\r\n1. In my implementation, the object managing the keys is purely reactive: It only reacts on input received from the QUIC stack (received packets, requests to encrypt a packet). With this proposal, it would need to take a more active role, triggering the sending of new packets on certain paths.\r\n1. A path might have died when this \u201ekey update probe packet\u201c is sent. This certainly can be solved by adding some additional logic what to do for paths that are abandoned during a key update, but this could potentially become complicated. Furthermore, this is fragile, because this logic will be rarely exercised and could lead to a situation where a node thinks that it\u2019s not allowed to initiate a key update and will there not be able to send any further packets.\r\n\r\n",

Idle timeouts are inherently racy: the start time will vary slightly between both endpoints (by about half an RTT), and a packet sent just before expiration of the idle timeout period might be received just after the expiration.\r\nThis is ok because running into the idle timeout will completely free up all resources associated with that connection, and stray packets will elicit stateless resets, allowing the other node to do the same.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure I fully understand how this applies to paths. It seems like there needs to be a clear signal that a path has been abandoned due to idleness. Sending this signal will be very cheap if it\u2019s bundled with frames that would be sent anyway on a different path.\r\n\r\nThat said, I\u2019m wondering if the idle timeout is really the right concept for paths to begin with. Peers usually apply some kind of keep-alive logic to keep a path alive, and that keep-alive period is based on the (presumed) characteristics of the path, such as the (presumed) timeouts applied by NATs, as well as the cost of sending a packet on that particular path. Would it make sense to introduce the concept of a path timeout, which could be attached to the PATH_ frames?",

This feels unnatural, since QUIC was designed such that CIDs can be rotated (potentially very) frequently, even in the absence of any path migration / probing.\r\n\r\nThe tight coupling in this draft leads to a whole range of problems:\r\n1. It complicates path state management. The CID used to establish a path might be retired, and a different CID may be used on that path. I'm struggling to figure out which sequence number to send in PATH_STATUS frames in this case. There's the risk that PATH_* frames can't be associated with a (still existing!) path because the CID was retired.\r\n2. When initiating a new path, there's a requirement to check that 1. the endpoint itself has a CID available for that path and 2. the peer also has a CID available. Note that this inherently racy: The peer might just have started using that CID on a different path.\r\n3. Loss recovery: As the packet number is reset to 0 when switching to a new CID. On the wire, this means that packets received on the same path now need to be acknowledged in separate ACK_MP frames. Implementations would now put a lot of effort into running loss recovery across the multiple packet number spaces belonging to the same path.\r\n\r\nI believe the design would become significantly easier if CIDs were scoped to the path to begin with:\r\n* This would mean adding a Path ID varint to the existing NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame (or alternatively, deprecating NEW_CONNECTION_ID in favor of a new MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame). Same for the RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame. Sequence numbers for CIDs would now be incremented per path (i.e. any path would start with CID number 0).\r\n* The `active_connection_id_limit` transport parameter could be reinterpreted to mean the maximum number of active connection IDs _per path_. It could be accompanied by a `active_path_limit` transport parameter to allow the client to limit the number of paths.\r\n\r\nI believe this would resolve the problems described above. In addition, this has a few nice properties:\r\n1. The server would explicitly limit how many paths it is willing to accept. Credit for additional paths could be granted over the lifetime of the connection by sending NEW_CONNECTION_ID with new path IDs.\r\n2. The utility of the \"Retire Prior To\" field of the RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame would be restored: \"Retire Prior To\" would only apply to CIDs issued on that particular path.\r\n3. A neat implementation strategy on the client side would be to bundle a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame for the new path in the packet containing the PATH_CHALLENGE frame. Maybe we could even introduce a protocol requirement that a client MUST NOT issue connection IDs for unused paths?\r\n4. It would simplify CID management when paths are retired: Just remove all CIDs associated with a path when (or shortly after) it's retired.\r\n\r\nIt has not escaped my attention that this proposal suggests another strategy for key management, which - among others - would simplify the key update problem. I'll follow up in a separate issue.",

In my mental model, a NAT rebinding doesn't open a new path (although it might require re-verification of the path as described in RFC 9000, Section 9). The client has no way of know when a NAT rebinding will happen / has happened, so it won't be able to anything about it: It will just continue sending with the old CID. That old CID would still be bound to the old Path ID.\r\n\r\nIn my proposal, the _only_ thing that would open a new path is the client consciously making the decision to do so: by using a CID associated with a fresh Path ID (in the common case, on a new 4-tuple).\r\n\r\nActually, I'd consider it a nice property that the server can now distinguish between a NAT rebinding (path ID stays constant) and initiation of a new path (new path ID is used).\r\n\r\n> You do not actually need to tie multiple number spaces together for loss recovery: you can merely rely on timers after closing a number space. But you may want to optimize: I have in fact added optimization code in Picoquic, so that receiving ACKs of packets sent later on the same path triggers packet-number based loss detection. This is not very hard.\r\n\r\nIt definitely breaks packet-number space loss recovery. I'm not sure how I'd retrofit this in my implementation without introducing a lot of complexity. I think we should strive for a design where no changes to the loss recovery logic are needed (other than initializing a new loss recovery context per path).",

In the current state, I looked at a notion of symmetric Path ID, given that paths must be bidirectional per RFC9000. Overall, I agree with all the properties in the initial message, and note some additional properties.\r\n\r\nA nice part of this proposal is that it decouples the notion of \"network paths\" (i.e., the 4-tuple, having some validation state,...) from \"logical QUIC paths\" and \"application packet number spaces\" (i.e., acknowledgments, number of concurrent active paths, recovery states, active/standby status,...). Advertising in advance using MP_CONNECTION_ID frames to which \"Path ID\" the provided CID simplifies the \"path handling\" when the CID used over a same 4-tuple changes (as they belong to the same packet number space, unlike the current state of the draft).\r\n\r\nAnother nice property relates to the \"connection migration\". The current draft \"overrides\" the handling defined by RFC9000 to let the server use any available network path. This means that if a client probes an network path just to check possible connectivity, it opens the door to that network path usage by the server, which may not always be wanted (the client can still advertise a Standby status over that path with PATH_STATUS/PATH_STANDBY, but this is only a scheduling suggestion, the client has no way to enforce this at server-side). With the Path ID proposal, the connection migration mechanism remains on a per-Path ID basis, enabling clients to probe a network path (using probing packets) without having the server moving the traffic towards that probed network path.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, basing the \u201cpath abandon\u201d mechanism on such Path ID sounds more robust than identifying paths through CIDs. A \u201cPATH_CLOSE\u201d frame could be defined and would force retiring all the CIDs associated to that Path ID and hence control the number of simultaneous network paths in use for non-probing packets. For the advertisement of status of the paths, they would also remain explicit, even if the CID used over a path changes.\r\n\r\nFinally, using Path IDs would enable per-path keys, though as a first step we could stay with the current nonce adaptation and includes the Path ID in the nonce instead of the CID sequence number.\r\n\r\nOf course, this introduces some additional wiring (MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID and MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames, the active_path_limit TP that must be advertised by both peers) and the multipath extension would be \"less minimal\".

When talking about diversion from RFC 9000, I'm surprised adding a new frame type is considered a big diff. It's really easy to build a frame parser, and we're not going to run out of frame types any time soon. Deviating from the design principles of RFC 9000 on the other hand can create an enormous amount of complexity.\r\n\r\nI agree that (1) and (3) would go away _iff_ you never rotate CIDs on an existing path. While rotating CIDs can be seen as an anti-ossification measure, I think I remember that @nibanks is using Retire Prior To field in the NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame with his RSS implementation in MsQuic.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this feature of RFC 9000 is effectively rendered useless, unless one wants to risk running into the corner cases described in section 4.3.3 around having established paths that don't have an associated CID (and therefore can't be addressed by PATH_* frames). I haven't implemented it yet in quic-go, but I imagine that this corner case would be rather annoying to deal with.\r\n\r\n(3) introduces a very big diff to RFC 9000: Loss recovery for the two packet number spaces created by rotating the CID on a path seems pretty complicated: You'd now either have to declare the packet sent with the old CID lost if it's not acknowledged, or implement loss recovery that spans the two packet number spaces. It's probably doable, but it's not trivial. It's also fundamentally different from QUIC v1, where rotating a CID on an existing path doesn't create a new packet number space.\r\n\r\n> * The need to prepare for having state of max(active_paths) * max(1 + backups_for_each_path), rather than just max(active_connection_id_limit).

I don't expect that there are many situations where you'd have more than 5 paths (that already seems quite a lot), and you don't need more than 2 or 3 CIDs per path, even if you want to allow for frequent rotation of CIDs.

But that does not happen frequently, I believe that is the same for others as well. Therefore, problem (1) is IMO not an issue in practice.\r\n\r\nNote that, in order to handle packets arriving late, an endpoint has to be capable for receiving packets with CIDs that it has issued in the past for at least 3 PTO. Therefore, even in the case of an endpoint rotating CIDs at full speed, there will be high chance of PATH_STATUS getting through.\r\n\r\nRe (3), when changing the CID of an existing path, all an endpoint needs to do is remember the delta (base offset) between the packet number sent on the wire and that being remembered by the loss recovery logic / congestion controller. To give an example, if an endpoint has sent using CID=X packets up to PN=1000, and wants to switch CID to Y, all it needs to remember is an offset of 1001. The first packet sent with CID=Y will carry PN=0, but internally, it would be handled as PN=1001 by adding the offset.\r\n\r\nThe remaining one is (2), but I do not consider that as an issue. In practice, a new CID is used when either of the following happens: i) a client tries to use a new path, ii) a server sends a packet to a new client address. To support these two cases, all that have to be done by the endpoints are provide as many as active_connection_id_limit CIDs, and by the clients to always keep one spare CID or two (see #221).\r\n\r\nNote that while QUIC v1 does not prohibit endpoints rotating CIDs for no reason, endpoints behaving as such risk themselves of losing CIDs, as [the peer might run out of CIDs and stop providing more](https://quicwg.org/base-drafts/rfc9000.html#section-5.1.1-6).\r\n\r\nPS.\r\n> You're right, you'd need to allocate a tiny bit more space for CIDs.\r\n\r\nThe amount of state that you need to retain depends on what you want to do e.g., in response to an apparent rebinding. As discussed in https://github.com/quicwg/multipath/issues/50#issuecomment-1617086967, for a server, it makes sense to bundle data in a probe sent in response to an apparent rebinding. In a request-response protocol, doing so saves an RTT. But to do so, you need more state per CID not to mention the complexity of reusing CCs across multiple paths; things are much easier with current design that allows a server to start using a new new packet number space for a new path that _the server_ observes (rather than letting the proposed \"path ID\" approach that lets only the client designate packet spaces).",

This was also discussed at length in issue #169 \r\n\r\nWe need to address this case and that makes the explicit path ID approach complicated. Having an explicit path ID seems logical easier and for sure it make sense for the mental model, however, encoding it in the protocol design means actually additional complexity.\r\n\r\nRegarding your issue list @marten-seemann:\r\n\r\nNote that we need to resign PATH_STATUS anyway (see issue #186). However, first, PATH_STATUS is only a recommendation. If you don't have PATH_STATUS information about a used CID, that doesn't automatically mean that you should use it. So If you see a CID change on a path, I don't think this should automatically change your scheduling. The other option is in the loose path model that you could even send PATH_STATUS information for issued but not yet-used CIDs in advance and thereby per-set that information. Or if you could also send the PATH_STATUS frame in the packet with a new CID or even repeat it multiple times if you really want to be sure. Again, we need to redesign PATH_STATUS and we need to consider the issue you describe; this is a known issue that wasn't fully resolved with the last revision.\r\n\r\nYou second point is discussed in issue #205 and it is incorrect to have a MUST requirement for the availability of CIDs on the other end. This is something you can't guarantee but this is already the case in RFC9000. So I think it's rather an editorial issue to remove this requirement from the current draft.\r\n\r\nRegarding loss recovery, I think @huitema answer this point already. The expectation is that you do not do loss recovery between to packet number spaces. If the CID and therefore the packet number changes and a loss might happen in that RTT, then recovery might be slower as you have to wait for a time-out. However, that's such a rare case that I wouldn't recommend to optimise it because of the complexity you describe above.\r\n\r\n  ",

With the current design, it is true that endpoints have to retain CIDs (and hence loss recovery and congestion control state) for some paths that act as standby. However, I do not think it mean that endpoints have to retain meaningfully more state than with the proposed design. It is my understanding that the amount of state an endpoint needs to track relates much more to the amount of data inflight (i.e., number of packets that needs to be tracked) rather than the number of paths being maintained.\r\n\r\n> 4. Packet numbers are now per path, not per CID. This makes rotating CIDs on a given path easier, as you can reuse the same loss detection / recovery context.

It would be nice though to not have to play any tricks at all.\r\n\r\nThis is true.\r\n\r\n> 5. We would restore the utility of \"Retire Prior To\" in NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames. Retire Prior To is most commonly used when the (load balancing) key is rotated. With the current proposal, it retires the CIDs used on (potentially) multiple paths, leaving paths without CIDs until a new CID is issued and used on the path. Retiring all CIDs for an existing path leads to the awkward corner case described in section 4.3.3 (note that this can also happen when using RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames). While path IDs won't prevent peers from retiring all CIDs for an existing path (and thereby making it impossible to send new packets on that path), you'd at least still be able to address that path (in frames sent on other paths), since you're referring to the path by its path ID.\r\n\r\nWhen an endpoint retires a set of CIDs, it is expected to issue a set of new CIDs that replace the old ones. That is the behavior expected by QUIC version 1, I do not think we have new information here to switch to a new design, considering the fact that QUIC version 1 has the capability of opening multiple paths and hence using multiple Connection IDs at once.\r\n\r\nThe difference (and the practical benefit of this \u201cPath ID\u201d proposal) are, IMO:\r\n* when Connection IDs are rotated, path status does not have to be communicated, and\r\n* when Connection IDs are rotated, you do not need the \u201ctrick\u201d (of transplanting loss recovery / congestion control state of the old CID to the new CID).\r\n\r\nThese are indeed benefits, but my impression is that it comes with the cost of changing the data structure from what QUIC version 1 expected for the stacks to have.\r\n\r\nIn QUIC version 1, an endpoint retains `active_connection_id_limit` paths, but all the state required for transmitting data (i.e., packet number space, ack queue, loss recovery, congestion control) are shared. The fact that these properties are shared across entire connection limits us to having only one active path at a time.\r\n\r\nCurrent state of Multipath draft makes these properties as per-path attributes, which is probably the minimal change that we have to make.\r\n\r\nWith the proposed change, however, path management is split into two layers.\r\n\r\nEach connection will have N \u201cpath\u201ds, each of them identified by their Path IDs. Within each \u201cpath,\u201d there will be actual paths as identified by the 4-tuple. When NAT rebind happens, it would be a migration within the \u201cpath\u201d as identified by the \u201cpath ID.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo paraphrase, essentially each \u201cpath ID\u201d space has its own path migration scheme, and a Multipath connection will consolidate these \u201cpaths\u201d (or sub-connections) so that data can be sent on more than one path concurrently.\r\n\r\nI can totally see that for some endpoints such design is easier to implement. I appreciate @michael-eriksson for bringing such experience to the table.\r\n\r\nBut for me, it would be a pain to support different types of data structures for QUIC version 1 (that directly maps paths as identified by 4-tuple to each connection) and Multipath (that will have connections mapped to \u201cpath IDs\u201d then each \u201cpath\u201d managing a set of 4-tuples).\r\n\r\n> 6. Abandoning a path currently means sending a PATH_ABANDON frame, and waiting for the retirement of the CID used on that path. Using path IDs would allow us to clean up all CIDs associated with that path.\r\n\r\nI think this problem statement is true.\r\n\r\n\u2028OTOH, for the sake of the Path ID proposal, I do not think we need the capability to issue / retire Path IDs? All we need to say is that if an endpoint declares that it is capable of handing N paths, path IDs between 0 to N - 1 are to be used.\r\n\r\nFor QUIC streams we do have such mechanism for issuing / retiring IDs, but that\u2019s because they are communicated above the packetization layer. Path IDs are concept at the packetization layer, reusing the same path ID on a different 4-tuple is no worse than a NAT rebinding.\r\n\r\nIf we are to adopt the Path ID proposal, I would prefer not having the complexity of issuing / retiring Path IDs.",

As outlined in RFC 9002, loss recovery can be done on a per-packet-number-space basis.

In this schema, the formal definition is straightforward: (1) the attribute **A** is the 4-tuple, (2) the **ID** corresponds to a value within the CID sequence number domain, (3) a mapping between the 4-tuple and the **ID**, and (4) a mapping between the **ID** and all the stateful information of a path are established.\r\n\r\nHowever, in cases requiring a stable path ID, we must reconsider what constitutes the attributes **A**. The 4-tuple alone is inadequate, necessitating additional context that encapsulates the notion of path continuity. Rigorously define the concept of continuity it is not straightforward. Furthermore, incorporating continuity into the definition of a path extends beyond the original scope set by RFC9000.",

You should open a specific issue with your suggestion.\r\n\r\n@huitema: I'm not sure it's so easy to separate the issues.\r\n\r\nArchitecturally, there are two models for multi-path operations: model (A) is a collection of uni-path QUIC constructs while model (B) is a uni-path QUIC construct operating over a collection of paths.\r\n\r\nModel (A) is like MPTCP and appears to be the model of the current MPQUIC design. Model (B) is like a TCP connection operating over a layer 2 link aggregation group. In (B), a TCP segment can be transmitted in an IP datagram over any of the links in the LAG.\r\n\r\nIf we apply (B) principles to MPQUIC, then path management is distinct from connection management. Conceptually the MPQUIC stack is an RFC 9000 entity sitting on top of a path management entity with a shim entity between them to direct a QUIC packet over one of the available paths.\r\n\r\nIn (B), a QUIC packet can be sent over any of the available (and unrestricted) paths. Since connection identifiers are independent of path, a QUIC packet received over any path is processed in the same way as a packet received over the single path construct of RFC 9000 - i.e. there is a single application data packet number space and an ACK received over any path is unambiguous (no need for MP-ACK).\r\n\r\nThese are basically the principles used for connection migration in RFC 9000. The difference is that MPQUIC provides multiple paths that can be simultaneously active and path usage is explicitly managed. Clearly congestion control must be path-specific but connection management and packet loss recovery are not path-specific.\r\n\r\nIn this model, it is hard to imagine a solution that does not include an explicit path identifier that is independent of connection identifiers.",

The concrete implementation of such a behaviour is implementation-specific, as this is a scheduling issue (starting from when do you consider that a path is not working anymore? if it experiences RTOs or being abandoned/closed?).

For instance, if you have p1 being standby by the seq being 19, and p2 being available, updated by seq 18, and the receive frames in the following order:\r\n\r\n- Status (p1, seq=22, available) : highest seq on p1, update p1 to available\r\n- Status (p2, seq=21, standby): highest seq on p2, update p2 to standby\r\n- Status (p1, seq=20, standby): not the highest seq on p1, ignore old information",

Without such information, the sender cannot determine if it should retransmit when a packet is deemed lost; the receiver cannot determine if the received frame contains the newest information.\r\n\r\nIn addition, by defining the sequence number as per-connection, the specification is requiring the sender to retain another state which is the per-connection sequence number. If we change the sequence number to be per-DCID, we do not need such state.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, using a per-DCID sequence number is more natural (because each state being sent will have it's own sequence number) and requires less state.",

If we say MUST, we can't really enforce it because the normal ACK frame is still used during the handshake and there is no clear moment when it has to change. We could say MAY to encourage it more to actually use the normal ACK frame for path 0 packets. The use case for this is when multipath is negotiated but you are only using one path (with path ID 0). However, a SHOULD covers this use case as well and it sounds like people do actually prefer if later during the connection only one kind of ACK is used.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion it sounds like the SHOULD is still fine. We could add one more sentence as say that the only case where not using MP_ACK makes sense is when only path 0 is used.

This is inline with the requirement of [Section 10.2](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-10.2) of [[QUIC-TRANSPORT](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#QUIC-TRANSPORT)] to ensure that paths close cleanly and that delayed or reordered packets are properly discarded. The effect of receiving a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame is specified in the next section.\r\n\r\nFor the sender of the PATH_ABANDON frame, the only information that it can discard is the ACK queue, because PATH_ABANDON asks _the peer_ to stop sending data on that path. However, the peer is still allowed to send probing packets on the path and therefore we need to retain the ack queue so that we can ACK the probing packets. To summarize, there is nothing that the sender of the PATH_ABANDON frame can discard until it receives RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID.\r\n\r\nFWIW, for the receiver of the PATH_ABANDON frame which is the sender of information, it does makes sense to retain loss recovery state as some packets may arrive as late as 3 PTO (that's the rational for 3 PTO in RFC 9000).",

The packet number spaces that RFC 9002 talks about are the *encryption* number spaces: Initial, Handshake and Application data.

The client implementations have to guess which of their IP address that is. In RFC9000 implementations, the client will typically assume that the token is linked to the IP address used during the handshake. \r\n\r\nThe tempting solution is to defined a \"better\" new token frame that carries the IP address verified by the server, but I would rather not try to define that as part of the multipath extension.

For clients behind NAT, that's not obvious. Adding ways to learn that smells a lot like dipping into peer-to-peer support, which definitely seems out of scope for the multipath draft.\r\n\r\nFor now, we might simply note the issue and that the token is tied to the client IP address used during the handshake.

An error code might help the receiver determine more quickly where a problem lies - but quite often these bugs are rare and easy to determine a root cause as long as awareness of _any_ issue is raised (e.g. I got a CONNECTION_CLOSE when hitting a server, and here is the repro URL)\r\n\r\nThis stuff is a bit subjective. \r\n\r\nI see 2 cases in the draft where MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION is used\r\n\r\n1) If an enable_multipath transport parameter is received and the carrying packet contains a zero length connection ID, the receiver MUST treat this as a connection error of type MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION and close the connection.\r\n\r\nThis is super easy to spot - its a critical error exceedingly early in a connection and its clear why the sender triggered it\r\n\r\n2) All multipath-specific frames relate to a Destination Connection ID sequence number. If an endpoint receives a Destination Connection ID sequence number greater than any previously sent to the peer, it MUST treat this as a connection error of type MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.\r\n\r\nThis one doesn't seem as easy as the first. However, the endpoint that receives the bogus frame can just indicate the frame type in the CONNECTION_CLOSE. It might also say something in the reason phrase.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn balance, it feels to me that dropping MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION would not make anyone's lives too hard, while saving the overhead of defining and implementing the error code.",

I find people may still be confused about that, and such a sentence could clarify things a lot. Currently, in our implementation, yes, we use PATH_CHALLENGE as an explicit signal when creating a new path. The logic on the server is to first process a path_challenge_frame and if the server does not find a path associated with the in-coming packet's dcid, then try to create a new path and validate the client's address.",

Having explicit signals like \"this path is available\" or \"keep this path on standby\" solves that in a much more robust way.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, we will probably see extensions.

The PATH_ABANDON frame therefore recommends to the receiver that no packets should be sent on that path anymore.\r\n\r\nThis means that PATH_ABANDON frame like **abort_reading** for the sender side, just like the RESET_STREAM frame does on the quic stream layer.\r\n\r\nAnd described in [6.2. ](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#section-6.2)[Path Closure](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#name-path-closure)\r\n\r\n> In this example, the client detects the network environment change (client's 4G/Wi-Fi is turned off, Wi-Fi signal is fading to a threshold, or the quality of RTT or loss rate is becoming worse) and wants to close the initial path.\r\n\r\nFor a specific 4-tuple, the sending and receiving paths of packets are not alway the same.  \r\nIn the scenario of HTTP file download, **the server can better understand the quality of  RTT or loss rate.**  So do we allow the server to **actively** stop sending and notify the peer?  \r\n\r\nMaybe a special frame similar to the STOP_SENDING frame is needed in multi-path quic?\r\n",

Note that as we don't have a path identified anymore the PATH_STATUS information in unidirectional and therefore it is possible that one peer says it okay to send on a certain path, while the other end does not what to receive anything on that same path.\r\n\r\nSo, \r\n1. If the receiver does not want to receive packets on a path, he can use PATH_STANDBY to notify the sender to stop sending on that path identified by the Destination Connection ID Sequence Number. The Destination Connection ID Sequence Number is generated by the receiver and passed to the sender via NEW_CONNECTION_ID or initial packet.\r\n2. The draft does not specify whether the sender can send PATH_STANDBY frame. The sender decides which path to send packets on according to the scheduling algorithm, and even if the sender wants to abandon a certain outbound path, it does not need to notify the receiver.\r\n3. Assuming the sender actually sent the PATH_STANDBY frame to the receiver, does this mean that the sender does not want to receive packets identified by the Destination Connection ID Sequence Number of PATH_STANDBY from receiver?\r\n\r\nplease correct me if I am wrong",

However, a QUIC connection is a simplified version of an MPQUIC connection, as it consists of only one master path, whereas an MPQUIC connection can include one or more master paths.\r\n\r\n![MPQUIC-conceptual-model](https://github.com/quicwg/multipath/assets/780807/467625c6-3312-4485-bcf1-548aabc584c0)\r\n\r\n(Note: The Initial/Handshake packet number spaces, which are discarded after the handshake is complete, have been omitted for clarity.)\r\n\r\nThe multipath mechanism is mostly consistent with the [draft-ietf-quic-multipath](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-quic-multipath), but some differences are emphasized as follows:\r\n* The master path and its slave paths in a QUIC/MPQUIC connection are collectively referred to as XPATH.  In other words, an XPATH consists of multiple paths, but only one of them is used for transmitting non-probing packets. The simultaneous transmission of non-probing frames on multiple **XPATH**s is allowed in an MPQUIC connection.\r\n* Require the use of non-zero Connection IDs in both directions. An endpoint MUST use different Connection IDs on different **XPATH**s. If the 4-tuple changes without the use of a new connection ID (e.g. due to a NAT rebinding), this is considered as a migration event.\r\n* Use the ACK frame to acknowledge the received packets, which should be sent on the same **XPATH**. However, we do not prevent future extensions from defining ACK_MP, and using it requires negotiation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages of the proposed approach:\r\n- It is easy to understand and implement.\r\n- It avoids introducing unnecessary problems, such as ACK ambiguity, RTT estimation, large deviation with QUIC, etc.\r\n- It does not prevent future extensions from defining ACK_MP for further improvement. \r\n  - The usage of ACK_MP may not be necessary in all scenarios where the ACK frame is used, such as packet acknowledgment, loss detection, reception history updating, RTT estimation, and various algorithms that rely on ACK.\r\n\r\n",

However, as each CID has its own PNS, this makes implementing MPQUIC more complicated and leads to sub-optimal performance in some cases.\r\n\r\nIn the following examples (Figure-1 & Figure-2), when NAT-rebinding happens on path-1, we have to create new PNSs that are associated with new CIDs,  associate the new PNSs with path-1, and simultaneously maintain both the old and new PNSs for some time (the old PNSs should not be released immediately for performance consideration as there could be unacked/inflight pkts). \r\n\r\nEven worse, if the client rotates the CID of path-1 after an idle period and NAT rebinding happens simultaneously, path-1 will experience a long timeout and be closed (Figure-3). If the client wants to resume the transmission on path-1, it has to reopen it.\r\n\r\nThe above issues are solved if we disable CID rotation on opened paths (Figure-4, Figure-5, and Figure-6): 1. No need to do the complicated management of multiple PNSs for each path; 2. CID rotation and NAT rebinding will never happen at the same time. \r\n\r\nThis actually simplifies the implementation of MPQUIC in practice.

Disregarding such a packet is inappropriate; instead, we should regard it as initiating a new path.

Take the somewhat common case in which a client has a connection working over Wi-Fi and wants to create a standby path over Cellular to enable fail-over. The client will create a path using path challenge, etc., and will then send the Path_Standby frame as soon as the path is created -- as @michael-eriksson points out, sending that sooner is a crap shot, because the client does not know which CID the server will pick. But the Path Standby frame or Path Available can be delayed for some time, for example in case of loss recovery. In that interval, the server will follow its default sending policy, which may not be what the client wants.\r\n\r\nI think this is solved nicely if we keep the old validation process of RFC 9000 as the default. If the server has not yet received a Path Standby or Path Available frame, it follows RFC 9000 -- which is \"standby until data is received from the client\".",

This interval is different from that of QUIC version 1 which used three times the PTO of the only one active path.`\r\n\r\nAfter having done some testing with key update in our implementations with different length paths some conclusions have been drawn.\r\n\r\nFirst is that it difficult for an endpoint to know when an old key can safely be dropped. With multiple path being possible to send on, and not necessarily used as well as to send ACKs on. Thus the fact that one get key phase back as a responder indicate that beyond on-path reordering things should be settled. But for multipath one can conclude for paths being used that key-phase changes have happened. But for path currently not receiving any packet one don't know if they are just being significantly delayed or may never have been sent. Also the path RTT samples one have might not be relevant for the current path delay. Thus, beyond observing that one get some key-phase change back, and starting a really long timer it is not obvious that you can generate an algorithm that enables one to know that no outstanding old keys are there. \r\n\r\nThe fact that this time needs to be longer than worst case RTT changes on each path do result that using 3*PTO is likely to short to re-enable key-update. At least unless one want to require trial decryption of the packets. This as keeping the old key while using the current key, so when one see a key-phase different one can try if it is the old key, if that fails and the next key works, then one drop the old key, and from that point assume this key-phase will be the new key. And thus initiating a key_update. \r\n\r\n",

Also, when the endpoint initiates a Key Update while the peer is trying to open a new path, RTT of the new path cannot be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nWhen recommending the Key Update interval, QUIC v1 only took the RTT estimate of its one and active path into consideration.

      "body": "The debate over whether to use a stable path ID #214  may have deeper logical underpinnings than initially perceived and hinge on whether there\u2019s an agreed-upon definition of a path. \r\n\r\nThe current draft considers defining a path as a 4-tuple between two endpoints. This definition currently shapes the draft design, where different 4-tuples are assigned unique IDs and linked to distinct packet number spaces, maintaining logical consistency as this definition alone does not incorporate the concept of path \"**continuity**\".\r\n\r\nThose with differing views (i.e., stable path ID) essentially contest this definition of a path, perhaps even unknowingly. To adopt a stable path ID, we must redefine what constitutes a path, incorporating the idea of \u201c**continuity**.\u201d \r\n\r\nBut defining continuity is challenging. It suggests creating a transition graph where paths sharing an ID can trace back to a common origin, illustrated by transitions like`A1 -----> A2 ------> A3\r\n`, where `A` is some observable attributes of a path.\r\n\r\nAn _imperfect_ example of such transition graph is based on the combination of CID and 4-tuple:\r\n`(CID0, tuple0) ----> (CID0, tuple1) -----> (CID1, tuple1)\r\n`. However, the first complexity arises when both CID and tuple change simultaneously, as in`(CID0, tuple0) ----????-----> (CID1, tuple1)\r\n`. Here, it\u2019s unclear if these represent the same or different paths, making it impossible to construct a definitive transition graph. The second issue is that forcefully linking two such nodes with a path ID could lead to anomalies. For instance when we tie CID to path ID #214, you might start on an LTE path (PathID1) and have a standby path on Wi-Fi (PathID2) in a restaurant. Moving to a shopping mall and connecting to its Wi-Fi, you initially use a CID associated with PathID2. Yet, even after a CID rotation post path validation, you remain linked to PathID2 because you would rotate to another CID assigned for that PathID, despite the Wi-Fi path, its ISP, and the MTU potentially being different. There is another proposal of sticking to the loose path ID model but allowing the use of the same packet number space, again the logic hinges on whether we have a well-defined **continuity** to build a definitive transition so that we can link two paths to the same packet number space with no ambiguity.\r\n\r\nGiven the years of back-and-forth on this issue, it seems helpful to first reach a consensus on the path definition. The design should logically follow from this agreed definition, similar to how different assumptions about parallel lines underpin Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries. Without a clear definition, when we say \"This is the same path because it has the same identifier\", we are potentially entering a circular reasoning zone and we should avoid logical fallacy like that.\r\n\r\nI could be wrong, but I think if we want to have a test of time design, we need to address the path definition unequivocally. Therefore, I would suggest to call for a consensus on a formal path definition. Two questions: (1) Do we like to incorporate \"**continuity**\" in the definition or stick to the current 4-tuple definition? (2) How to come up with a formal definition to incorporate the idea of **continuity** in path definition?",

          "body": "Some clarity would be good. \r\n\r\nThe mechanism that I do understand is the numbering space. It is a tool that we use to number packets sent over one of the possible 4 tuples between two endpoints. This is important for several reasons:\r\n\r\n* numbering space is tied to loss recovery. Loss recovery becomes less effective in presence of out of order delivery. Loss recovery works well if all packets numbered from the same space arrive in order. Sender try to ensure that by sending packets from a given number space on the same four tuple. This is imperfect, because of NAT, but it is also the best that senders can do.\r\n* numbering space is tied to encryption, which require a unique nonce. This works well if we combine the packet number and the identifier of the numbering space in the nonce.\r\n* when receiving a packet, the receiver must use the same nonce as the sender. The receiver needs to identify the number space and the packet number from the packet header. The receiver cannot solely rely on the four tuple, because of NAT. The only element that the receiver can use is the connection ID.\r\n\r\nSo far, this means selecting a number space and one or several packet IDs to send on a given four tuple. Two designs can work: 1-1 mapping between connection ID and number space, or 1-N mapping, in which several connection ID point to the same number space.\r\n\r\nUp to this point, we do not require any tie between the two directions of communications. The tying happens because if the client starts sending using a 4 tuple, the server may decide to send using the symmetric 4 tuple. The server discovers a possible \"sending path\" by receiving packets from the client. Thus, a bit of complexity:\r\n\r\n* the client may want to control how the server uses this path. This is the role of the Path Available, Path Standby and Path Abandon frames. \r\n* the mapping between number space and 4-tuple will occasionally change, because of NAT. If the server derived a 4 tuple from packets received from the client, it needs to change that 4 tuple if it detects a NAT rebinding. There will necessarily be a period of uncertainty during which client and server don't have quite the same notion of 4-tuples.\r\n* the endpoints must be able to change the connection ID associated with a four tuple for privacy reasons, and also because connection IDs may have a limited lifetime.\r\n* the endpoints need to somehow agree to free the resource linked to a number space when it is not in use.\r\n\r\nThe \"1-1 mapping between CID and number space ID\" solves these requirements, but does induce a discontinuity in packet number when a connection ID is rotated. \r\n\r\nThe \"1-N mapping between number space and CID\" can also solve these issues. It does make CID rotation easy to handle, including when CID rotation is combined with NAT rebinding. The mapping does require some additional code for handling the 1-N mapping, such as for example a new \"new CID\" frame that links a CID to a path identifier. \r\n\r\nThe 1-N mapping also requires extra care when abandoning a path and freeing the resource, because just retiring a CID does not retire the number space. For example, does abandoning a number space automatically induce retiring the CID tied to that number space? How to handle arrival of packets for a CID that is not retired yet, but is tied to a retired number space?\r\n\r\nBack to @yfmascgy question: I think we get much clarity if we focus on number spaces instead of focusing on the actual definition of a path. I also think that we should be very explcit with our handling of Path directions. For the MP ACK, this is simple: the number space identifier is that used by the sender of the packets being acknowledged. For the Path Abandon, this is less clear. Is the statement \"I will not send anything more using that number space\" (i.e., local sender space ID), or \"Please don't send anything anymore with that number space\" (i.e., remote sender space ID)?\r\n",

With the existence of middleboxes between QUIC endpoints, the thing that defines a \"path\" may be different from the perspective of the different endpoints - e.g. the source IP address and UDP port that is inserted into an IP datagram by a sender may not be that same as the source IP address and UDP port seen in the the IP datagram by the receiver. And, as RFC9000 took pains to describe, the source IP address and UDP port seen in the the IP datagram by the receiver may change over time without the knowledge of the sender, resulting in (passive) connection migration.\r\n\r\nWithout the use of a path identifier that is independent of the 4-tuple, it is hard to see how the endpoints can have any meaningful dialogue regarding \"paths\". Some would argue that this independent path identifier should be a connection identifier, others would argue that it should be an explicit path identifier selected by an endpoint.\r\n\r\nIt might be worthwhile to look at the events that might result in the declaration of a new path. I don't think a receiver can unilaterally declare a new path based only on the detection of a passive connection migration (i.e. a change in the source IP address and/or UDP port seen in the a IP datagram).\r\n\r\nA sender may determine that it is using a new path based on:\r\n\r\na) a change in the source IP address used by the sender, and/or\r\n\r\nb) a change in the network access point used by the sender.\r\n\r\nNote that (b) often results in (a) but there are some access networks where the same source IP address can be used across different access points.\r\n\r\nThere are some deployments where (a) and/or (b) are hidden from the peer endpoint by the intervening network.

      "body": "I did a big batch of debugging the \"unique path-id\" code in picoquic, porting all the tests that were designed for the previous multipath version, and I found an interesting issue in the \"standup\" test. The test starts by setting a client to server connection with two paths, one available and on in standby. It runs for a while, then simulates cutting the \"available\" path off. Expectation is that the connection will continue with the \"standby\" path. The test was initially failing.\r\n\r\nThe simulated traffic is from server to client. The server quickly detects that the available path is down, and starts sending data packets on the \"standby\" path. But the client only sends ACK, and does not react quickly if ACK packets are not acknowledged. So the client keeps sending ACKs on the \"available path\". Of course, since the path is cut, they are dropped. The server does not see ACKs for the packets sent on the \"standby\" path, so it quickly concludes that this path is down. Pretty soon, the connection breaks.\r\n\r\nThere are two potential fixes. One would be to somehow force ACKs on the standby path, if packets are received on that path. The other, which I feel is more robust, is for the server to send mark the standby path as \"available\" if the available path is \"broken\". I did that, \"promote\" the standby path to available, and the \"standup\" test now succeeds.\r\n\r\nThis issue might deserve some discussion in the multipath draft.",

In my implementation, that's on first PTO. Of course, the PTO may or may not be due to a link failure, but hopefully is is infrequent enough that using the standby path briefly in case of PTO does not break the \"spirit\" of putting a path in standby.\r\n\r\nSending an \"abandon path\" immediately would also force traffic onto the standby path, but is is more drastic. If the packet loss situation was temporary, it causes the system to stop using the \"available\" path forever. In contrast, promoting the standby path to \"available\" is easily reversible. if after a PTO or a couple RTO the \"available\" path is restored, the client can decide to put the standby path back in standby mode.",

          "body": "This issue reminds me the experience I had when trying to optimise the latency of applications on smartphone devices with MPTCP and older non-standard MPQUIC implementations where the WiFi is considered as cheap and the cellular expensive. When smartphone users are initially connected to WiFi and moving away from their access point, they may eventually be out of WiFi reachability, leading to packet losses. There is often some delay between applications experiencing packet losses and the system declaring the WiFi as lost. During that timeline, the WiFi path acts as a blackhole.\r\n\r\nThe path priority (available/standby) is a scheduling concern, and each endpoint runs its own algorithm. It is up to each endpoint to determine when to start using \"standby\" paths. The \"path health status\" is also a local information, and depending on your traffic (fully upload or fully download), only one endpoint may be aware of a lossy path. Scheduling decisions at both sides impact the performance of the multipath transfer.\r\n\r\nI see two ways of handling this:\r\n- Either we define some informative frame about the \"path health status\". I had such a concept in my research experiments at that time, where a \"path health status\" frame advertises to the other endpoint that the related path suffers from connectivity issues. It is unlikely that we are going to define such a frame in the core multipath draft.\r\n- Or we could suggest to implementers (implementation considerations) to make a \"pure receiver\" (i.e., only receiving data, not sending any) to generate ack-eliciting frames (such as PING) from time to time to proactively detect that there is connectivity issue on that path.

There is bound to be a delay between the time the sender notices packets are not getting acked and the time a pure receiver notices that the occasional PING is not acked.

For a specific bidirectional path, do both endpoints use the same path ID, or independently choose which path ID to use?\r\n```\r\n\r\n**@[qdeconinck](https://github.com/qdeconinck) qdeconinck [on Nov 22, 2023](https://github.com/quicwg/multipath/issues/new#r1402413785)**\r\n```\r\nI would keep the same logic as we did until now, i.e., each endpoint independently choose the Path ID it should use over a path. However, this \"Path ID\" (Flow ID may be more appropriate) would remain stable over a given path, even if the CID change.\r\n\r\nI have two concerns about forcing such synchronisation of Path ID:\r\n\r\n- Clients may try to create paths with Path IDs that are never seen by the server. For instance, Path ID 0 works, and it wants to try two additional paths, respectively with Path ID 1 and Path ID 2. However, the network path tried with Path ID 1 does not work and the server only sees Path ID 2 packets. If the client finally retires its Path ID 1, should the server also drop all related resources about its Path ID 1?\r\n- This would create issues if, for some use cases (like P2P), we would like the server to create paths to the client. What would happen if for some reason, both the client and the server try to open at the same time a path over the same network, but with different Path IDs?\r\n```\r\n\r\n**@[yangfurong](https://github.com/yangfurong) yangfurong [on Nov 23, 2023](https://github.com/quicwg/multipath/issues/new#r1402866322)**\r\n```\r\nIndeed, if both endpoints are allowed to initiate paths, it is better to not sync path IDs.\r\n```\r\n\r\n **@[michael-eriksson](https://github.com/michael-eriksson) michael-eriksson [on Nov 23, 2023](https://github.com/quicwg/multipath/issues/new#r1403326051)**\r\n```\r\nI would much prefer if paths had the same identifier in both directions, just like streams do.

If also servers will be able to open paths, client-initiated path could use even path IDs and server-initiated path odd path IDs -- a direct reuse of the stream design.\r\n\r\nIt's actually another way to somehow ''split'' the path ID spaces of endpoints. It solves the second problem as @qdeconinck pointed out. The only thing is how we define the TPs which limit the number of concurrent paths. There might be some options here. For examples:\r\n\r\n- We use one TP to indicate the number of concurrent paths that the sender is willing to accept. For instance, if both endpoints send ''2'', there will be four concurrent paths at maximum (each endpoint can initiate two paths).\r\n- We use two TPs where one indicates the max number of paths to be accepted by the sender and another one represents the max number of paths the sender wishes to initiate. This design allows endpoints to negotiate the total number of concurrent paths while the former one just informs the local decision to a peer.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**@[huitema](https://github.com/huitema) huitema [on Nov 26, 2023](https://github.com/quicwg/multipath/issues/new#r1405475249)**\r\n```\r\nI think we need to get a consensus on the management of path identifiers. I also think that we would get much better clarity if the client and server ended up using the same path ID values. Something like:\r\n\r\n1. The client proposes an initial number of paths, which limits how many path ID the server can \"pre allocate\" (to use @Yanmei-Liu terms)\r\n2. Both the server and the client pre-allocate connection identifiers, with path ID lower than the proposed limits.\r\n3. Client that starts a new path picks one of the server allocated CID, selecting the path ID.\r\n4. Server receiving a packet referencing a not yet use path ID must reply with client-allocated connection ID mentioning the same path ID.\r\n  - If the client has not yet allocated any such path ID, the server cannot send data on that new path.\r\n  - the client can always provide a new CID in messages containing a path challenge.\r\n  - the server can control how many paths will be open by simply limiting how many path ID it mentions.\r\n5. \"Abandon path(N)\" is handled pretty much like connection close, but just for the path. Any peer can send it, but the path is only closed if both do, or if RTO pass.\r\n  - if a path is abandoned, we should say what happens if the peer keeps using it. Drop the packets? Repeat the Abandon Path message?\r\n6. Path ID cannot be reused. If a path_id is abandoned, all CID allocated for that path should be retired.\r\n7. The client can use a MAX_PATH_ID frame to increase the number of supported paths.\r\n```",

Reusing the same identifier would require either continuing the previously used sequence number space, otherwise the nonce would not be unique.

Then there is the risk of confusion, what happens if old packets are delivered from a previous path using the path identifier.\r\n\r\nWe should make this very clear in the design. If the design goes for \"re-use\", then the node has to allocate an array of number spaces for the negotiated max number of spaces, and keep that for the duration of the connection. The effect of \"Abandon path\" becomes complicated -- if a CID for path N has never been used, should it be retired?\r\n\r\nIf the design goes for \"unique path ID\", the management of path and sequence numbers becomes simpler, but we need some logic to enforce the \"maximum number of active paths\". An advantage there is that endpoints can allocate more CID and more path than really needed, so the endpoint is always ready to start a new path after a previous one has been abandoned.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**@[kazuho](https://github.com/kazuho) kazuho [on Nov 21, 2023](https://github.com/quicwg/multipath/issues/new#r1400043855)**\r\n```\r\nI do not feel strongly, but I think current design is fine as is.\r\n\r\nIn the new design, a QUIC Multipath connection that support N concurrent paths is essentially equivalent to N QUIC v1 connections running in parallel.

One of the nice things with QUIC is that it doesn't reuse any identifiers, not even packet numbers, which makes implementations cleaner and simpler.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to limiting the number of paths, I think there are two main designs:\r\n\r\n1. Reuse the design for connection IDs: limit the number of active paths. The max number of active CIDs is signalled as a transport parameter (active_connection_id_limit) and an endpoint is allowed to issue a new CID only after the peer has retired a previous CID. Analogously, an endpoint would only issue CIDs for a new path after a previous path had been abandoned.\r\n2. Use a MP_MAX_PATHS frame to dynamically allow new paths (similar to a MAX_STREAMS frame).\r\n\r\nIn short summary, 1. has less signalling and 2. can dynamically adapt the number of concurrent paths.

When a packet is received, you anyway need to look up the per-path state, and the packet number space in particular, before you can expand the truncated packet number and then decrypt the packet which means that you can trivially also access the path ID.\r\n\r\nThere is also https://github.com/quicwg/multipath/issues/215 (now closed) as another solution to the nonce handling.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**@[huitema](https://github.com/huitema) huitema [on Nov 26, 2023](https://github.com/quicwg/multipath/issues/new#r1405471433)**\r\n```\r\nI like@kazuho's suggestion of using the same logic for controlling path ID as for controlling stream ID, but there is a little complicating factor. Stream ID are allocated in clear contexts (uni/bidir, client/server), and then the same stream ID is used in both directions. In the current design, stream IDs are allocated as part of CID, and there is no guarantee that client and server pick the same ID for a new path. DO we want to also handle that?\r\n```",

When a client wants to create a new path, it is supposed to use a \"new\" path_id, select CID that match the path ID, send a Path Challenge, and wait for the Path Response. The Path Response may well never arrive. That means that the Path ID is \"burned\" for the client, but also for the server. But the server does not know, will not know until the client sends a Path Abandon. We should be clear that the client should do that. We should also clarify how the Path Abandon causes all the CID allocated for the path ID to be retired.\r\n```",

In regards to if the peer can remove agency for ones implementation to control its resources, like opening up paths in a legal way. So that is design issue.

Especially as the one receiving one a path can retire the connection ID, as well as the sender can indicate that it will not use it. However, to my understanding of how the frames are defined this can only be used in a particular direction. If A sends to B using DCID=X, which has sequence number Y. Then PATH_ABANDON with sequence Y can only be sent by B to A. And RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID can only be sent by A with seq=Y referencing DCID=X. \r\n\r\nTo my understanding of the text, this procedure is happening per direction independent and each path is going a unidirectional. However, one normally initiate the reverse direction path also. So I think it would be good if these section were a bit clearer with the various endpoints role in regards to who issued the CID etc so that it is less unclear in which direction this can be used. Because at first I thought you have reversed the usage of RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID. But that does not appear possible.\r\n\r\nSo I think the problem is that the document is not clear on when paths are used bi-directional, and when the path state in each direction can be different.

CIDs are managed using two frames:\r\n\r\n* MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID with parameters CID value, path ID, sequence, and retire prior.\r\n* MP_RETIRE_CID with parameters path ID and sequence.\r\n\r\nPath IDs are not supposed to live forever. If a path is abandoned, the path ID will not be reused, because of potential ambiguity: reusing path id and sequence numbers could break encryption; when packets arrive for an abandoned path ID and the path state has been delete, there is no way to distinguish new packets from copies of old packets. Yet, as long as there is a valid CID available, nothing prevents a node from using it and sending packets with that corresponding path_id.\r\n\r\nThe sender of the MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID can only force retirement of old path IDs by sending an MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame and setting the \"retire prior\" value, but doing so creates a new CID for the old path and does not actually \"retire all CID for the path\".\r\n\r\nIn the current specification, these \"old path CID\" can only be retired by the peer, who could send series of MP_RETIRE_CID frames. The local node knows that the path is abandoned, so it could refrain from providing new CID to replace them. But nothing forces the peer to do that.\r\n\r\nWe miss a way to say \"retire all CID for that path\". One way would be to state that as a side effect of \"PATH_ABANDON\": the peer should immediately retire all CIDs tied to that path. We should also specify that a node MUST retain knowledge of all valid CID until they have been retired -- otherwise we get issue like a peer sending packets with old CID values, resulting in a stateless reset. Instead, the node that receive a packet with an old CID for an abandoned path should probably just ignore it. \r\n\r\nMaybe there are simpler solutions, but the current behavior is under-specified.\r\n",

Suppose the client sends \"Abandon path 1\", and after some delay, maybe 3*RTO, implicitly retires the CID that he sent on path 1. And then suppose that the server was somehow slow in receiving and processing the ABANDON_PATH, and has kept sending 1RTT packets over path 1. Once the CIDs have been implicitly retired, they will elicit StatelessReset, which may well cause the server to abandon the whole connection.\r\n\r\nI think we could solve that by redefining the \"Path Abandon\" frame. Currently, it only imposes actions to its recipient: stop sending. Going implicit with that creates an implicit race condition, because the sender will act upon those actions \"as if the recipient has done them\"... but can only guess whether the recipient has in fact processed the frame.\r\n\r\nIf we reverse the meaning from \"please do not send\" to \"I will not send anymore\", the race condition disappears. The recipient can act on that immediately, because it knows that the sender has already stopped sending. If the recipient reply with its own \"Path Abandon\", the loop is closed, and there is no ambiguity. The nodes may still want to wait 3*RTO after Path Abandon frames have been sent and received to ensure there are no lingering frames in the network, but the race condition has disappeared.\r\n",

          "body": "(Copied from #367:)\r\n\r\nThe PATH_ABANDON ought to be a commitment to not send data anymore on the specified path. Not sending data on the path implicitly means that the endpoint will not use any of the MP_NEW_CID sent by the peer for the abandoned path. De facto, that's equivalent to retiring these CIDs: they will not be used anymore. Sending explicit MP_RETIRE_CID is just overhead, or maybe worse than overhead.\r\n\r\nIn monopath QUIC, sending a RETIRE_CID is useful because it can trigger production by the peer of a NEW_CID. But in the PATH_ABANDON scenario, there is no point: if the peer produced more MP_NEW_CID frames, they will just be unused. Since there is no point, some implementations may be tempted to not do it. The endpoint could just silently drop the unused CID, and would not suffer any consequence. The peer, on the other hand, will be stuck with a list of \"zombie CID\" that have no utility and just consume memory. So, if we look at the endpoint that receives the path Abandon, its interest is to free resource asap, whether MP_RETIRE_CID frames are received after the path Abandon or not.\r\n\r\nThe main synchronization issue is the \"stateless reset\" risk. When an endpoint sends a PATH ABANDON, there maybe some packets in transit that will be delivered out of order. If the peer has deleted all knowledge of the path-associated CID, the CID in the out of order packets will not be recognized, and the peer will send a \"stateless reset\" packet.\r\n\r\nWe could specify a complex solution to eliminate the stateless reset risk, such as ask to retain knowledge of the old CID for 3*PTO after receiving the PATH_ABANDON. That will reduce the risk of generating stateless reset packets, but it will not eliminate it. But then, stateless reset packets only have an effect if they can be verified, if the last 16 bytes match the \"Stateless Reset Token\" of a valid CID for the connection. If the sender of the path abandon has freed all resource associated with the CIDs for the abandoned path-ID, it will also have deleted the corresponding stateless reset tokens. The stateless reset packet sent by the peer thus will not be recognized as a valid stateless reset, and will have no effect on the state of the connection.\r\n\r\nThus, I think that the proper behavior should be:\r\n\r\n* When sending a path abandon frame, immediately free the resource associated with the CIDs received from the peer for that path.\r\n\r\n* When receiving a path abandon frame, assume that it carries an implicit \"retire CID\" for all the CIDs sent to the peer, and free the corresponding resource after a short delay, maybe 3*PTO.\r\n\r\n",

Usually for a graceful shut-down you need two things.\r\n\r\n1) Wait until all in flight data has been received\r\n2) Retain the ability to send control frames, e.g. ACKs\r\n\r\nThat's what the current design tries to support. You indicate your \"interest\" in closing a path by telling the other end to stop sending by sending the path_abandon frame, then you wait for 3 PTOs until all data is received and only then you retire the CID which means you are also not able to send on the path anymore.\r\n\r\nHowever, in case of multipath we only need 1) and we don't need 2) because by definition we always have still another path to send control frame because otherwise it would be connection close.\r\n\r\nTherefore we could say path_abandon is both 1) a request to the other peer to stop sending and 2) a commitment to not send anymore on the path. That means the peer sending the path_abandon frame could release all CIDs immediately it is using for sending. However, it would still need to wait 3 PTOs before it could remove ressources for the CIDs issued to the other end to receive all in flight data.

And we'd also able to have a graceful shut-down for paths if we design it like:\r\n\r\n1. Endpoint A sends Path Abandon to retire the associate Path ID resource. After it sends out the Path Abandon frame, the endpoint only process ACK_MP for inflight packets on this path within 3 PTO. In this period, it could retransmit Path Abandon / ACK_MP on the path for graceful shutdown, and also telling the peer that it\u2019s closing the Path if receives any other packet on the Path. After that, it frees all the resource associated with the Path ID (including all the CIDs belonging to this Path ID).\r\n2. When endpoint B receives Path Abandon for a specific Path ID, it sends Path Abandon as response to inform the peer that it also start to graceful shutdown, and also sends ACK_MP for the Path Abandon (Note that these 2 frames could be encode in the same packet for performance). \r\n3. After Endpoint A 1)sends Path Abandon, 2)received ACK_MP for the Path Abandon sent by itself, and also 3)received Path Abandon sent by the peer for the same Path ID, It could release all the Path resources associated with the Path ID immediately. \r\n4.

          "body": "I'm not sure if you can automatically release all resources if you received an ack for your path abandon frame and a path abandon from the peer for the same path because packets can be re-ordered. You can retire implicitly all CIDs for the path that where issued by the peer as soon as you have received the path abandon from the peer and have sent your path abandon (no need to wait for the ack) but you still have to remember the CIDs you issued and the path ID until all packets up to the packet with the path abandon frame are ack'ed or declared lost (after 3 PTOs). Alternatively if we don't want to considered re-ordering as re-ordered packet that are not processed anymore could be retransmitted on another path, you can retire all CIDs and packet processing state as soon as you have received the path abandon from the peer and you only  have to remember the path ID until your abandon frame is ack'ed.\r\n\r\nAlso I think we always should try to retransmit the path abandon given we have multiple paths to do that. As the path abandon is basically by definition the last frame you sent on a path, that means you will always detect loss by a time-out. That means a) that if you have to retransmit the path abandon, you always have to retransmit it on another path anyway. And b) in this case you actually cannot just free the path resources fully yet as you have to remember the path ID to retransmit the path abandon.\r\n\r\nThere are actually a couple of corner cases here to consider:\r\n\r\n1) If you've sent a path abandon, then didn't receive an ack for it (yet) but you received a path abandon from the peer, that's probably a \"new\" path abandon request from the peer, so you should \"re-transmit\"/send a path-abandon on another path right away in response. After receipt of the abandon from the peer you can immediately retire all CIDs that where issued by the peer for that path ID. Again, you still have to remember the path ID though for retransmission until you receive an ack for your path abandon.\r\n\r\n2) If you received the ack for your path abandon but no path abandon from the other end, you should wait for 3 PTO and then force path closure and remove all state for this path ID including all the CIDs. For the ones you issued for this path ID, you could maybe send MP_RETIRE_CIDS frames on another path in order to enforce that the other peer cannot send anymore. In this case any in flight data with those CIDs is lost (but of course the peer can retransmit them on another path).\r\n\r\n3) You've sent a path abandon and you didn't receive an ack or a path abandon from the peer, there are two cases: The path that you've sent the path abandon on is broken and you should retransmit it on another path and wait again for 3 PTOs. If there is no other working path anymore, you should close the connection. If you didn't receive an ack for your path abandon but you received other acks on that path, you retransmit the path abandon based on the normal loss detection rule. In this case it is not clear to me if you want to restart the 3 PTO timer or not. However, at some point you probably have to decide to simply remove all path related ressources and not retransmit the path abandon anymore and not process any data for that path anymore, or alternatively close the whole connection with an error such that a peer refusing to send acks cannot force you to keep path state open for ever. Also similarly as above if you remove path state without having received a path abandon from the peer, you could probably still send MP_RETIRE_CIDS for all CIDs of that path.",

They seem to be an unnecessary complexity to me.\r\n\r\nThe simpler design would be to say that if an endpoint is capable of handling N paths simultaneously, it would use path IDs between 0 and N-1 for the lifetime of the connection, regardless of how many times paths are migrated, either voluntary or involuntary.\r\n\r\nWhen a receiver receives packets on a new path, it has to perform path validation and reset CC regardless of if the received packets carry a new path ID or a old one. Therefore, I think there is not much effort in having the complexity of issuing and retiring path IDs within the protocol.\r\n\r\nThe downside of reusing path IDs is that endpoints have to remember the last packet number it sent / received on paths that become idle. But that cost would likely be smaller than having the cost of maintaining a dynamic list of path IDs that are alive.",

      "body": "We have a lingering issue of whether to support sender-initiated paths or not. We have dodged this issue so far, because clients will often be located behind NAT or firewalls, which would cause server packets to be dropped if they did not match a 4-tuple previously used by the client. In that case, the server would not directly try to open paths, but might instead suggest IP addresses and port numbers that the client could use in path openings. But there are scenarios in which the client is not behind a firewall, and in which sender initiated path could be a performance improvement.\r\n\r\nIn the \"unique path ID\" scenario, we risk a collision if the sender and the client try to initiate different paths at the same time. Suppose that the client has addresses C1 and C2, the server addresses S1 and S2. The client is not yet aware of S2, and the server is not yet aware of S1. Path 0 has been established with the tuple C1-S1. The peers have both provided CID for Path-ID=1. The collision happens if, at the same time, client and server try to open path 1 as follow:\r\n\r\n* Client selects the server CID with path-ID=1, sequence=0, and sends a \"PATH_CHALLENGE\" from source address C2 to server address S1.\r\n* Server selects the client CID with path-ID=1, sequence=0, and sends a \"PATH_CHALLENGE\" from source address S2 to client address C1.\r\n\r\nWhat follows depends on transmission order and local decisions, but is essentially non-deterministic. We might get a new path 1 with tuples C2-S1, C1-S2, or maybe C2-S2 or C1-S1.\r\n\r\nWe have discussed ways to avoid that, by splitting the \"path ID\" space in two. When the the client starts a path, it should use a CID with an even sequence number path, and the server should pick an odd sequence number space. The example above would become:\r\n\r\n* Client selects the server CID with path-ID=2, sequence=0, and sends a \"PATH_CHALLENGE\" from source address C2 to server address S1.\r\n* Server selects the client CID with path-ID=1, sequence=0, and sends a \"PATH_CHALLENGE\" from source address S2 to client address C1.\r\n\r\nThis becomes deterministic, which we like, but it makes the management of path numbers more complex. If we follow the rules set for MAX_STREAMS, we would need the following behavior:\r\n\r\n1. MAX_PATHS=N should be interpreted differently whether N is even or odd.\r\n2. MAX_PATHS=2*N+1 indicates the largest \"odd\" path number than the sender supports.\r\n3. MAX_PATHS=2*N indicates the largest \"odd\" path number than the sender supports.\r\n4. The largest negotiated odd number is the lowest of the MAX_PATHS odd numbers send by client and server\r\n5. Ditto odd numbers.\r\n6. Both peers MAY provide CID for even and odd path numbers, within the limits of values allowed.\r\n7. A new path can only created if both peers have provided MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID with that path value\r\n8. Clients can only initiate even numbered paths, servers can only initiate odd numbered paths.\r\n\r\nWe need to decide now whether we want to do that. A fall back position would be to state that \"this version of multipath only support even numbered path ID, odd numbers will be used if and when we support server initiated path-ID.\"",

That will not work naturally if the client just picks the first address returned by the DNS. The client has connection set with Cluster2, IPv4: a2. The DNS proposes AAAA records for IPv6:aa1 or IPv6:aa2. If the client sends a \"PATH_CHALLENGE\" towards IPv6:aa1, it will arrive at Cluster 1, the CID will probably not be recognized, and the challenge will fail.\r\n\r\nHowever, since the DNS has returned 2 IPv6 addresses, the client could prepare as many path challenges as it has learned addresses. That's a bit wasteful, but one of them will arrive at Cluster2, and if the CID is recognized and routed to the correct server the second path will eventually be established.\r\n\r\n@yangfurong we have discussed similar scenarios before. The general consensus is that handling the general case for \"client connects to an alternate server address\" would require a new frame, through which the server advertises a list of addresses -- see for example [this discussion](https://github.com/quicwg/multipath/issues/47#issuecomment-1010140751). We explicitly decided to not do that in the first version of the multipath draft -- it is already very complex, and we don't need the extra complexity of this feature now.

      "body": "During the processing of PR #272, we discussed separating the path identifiers in two classes: client initiated path identifiers, with even numbers, and server initiated path identifiers, with odd numbers.\r\n\r\nSeparating the identifiers in two classes allows clients and servers to both initiate paths, without risking identifier collisions. The current single-class design only works because only the client initiates paths. Otherwise, we would have the risk of both client and servers picking the same path identifiers, and simultaneously sending \"path challenges\" with the same identifier, but using different IP addresses and UDP ports. This would create confusion.\r\n\r\nThe design itself is fairly simple: both endpoints advertise odd and even path identified connection identifiers. When the client creates a path, the client picks an available even numbered identifier advertised by the server; when the server creates a path, it picks an odd numbered identifier. When receiving a packet for a new path, each endpoint verifies that the new number is authorized. For example, if the client receives from the server a message on a new path, it verifies that the path identifier of the connection ID chosen by the server is odd. If not, it MAY signal an MP protocol violation. When responding, the endpoint picks a connection ID with the same path identifier as that of the incoming packet.\r\n\r\nThat much is clear, but then we have to look at the impact of the odd/even design on the number of paths in the `initial_max_paths` transport parameter, and in the `MAX_PATHS` frame. If we follow the design of the max streams design in RFC 9000, we should replace the `initial_max_paths` parameters by two separate parameters:\r\n\r\n* initial_max_paths_client: maximum number of path that the client may inititiate,\r\n* initial_max_paths_server: maximum number of path that the server may inititiate.\r\n\r\nFor each of those, the maximum would be the minimum of the values advertised by client and server. Instead of writing that the multipath option is not used if the `initial_max_paths` parameter is not present, we would have something a bit more complicated, i.e., stating that the frames are only used if at least one of the parameters is present.\r\n\r\nThen we would also have to split the `MAX_PATHS` frame into `MAX_PATHS_CLIENT` and `MAX_PATHS_SERVER`.\r\n\r\nAll that is doable, but I wonder whether this complexity is justified. Maybe what we need instead is just a way to resolve the \"path identifier collision\". For example, assuming just on path identifier space, we could have a \"client win\" rule: if the client creates path N with a specific 4 tuple and then receives a path message with identifier N from the server using a different 4 tuple, it just ignores it; if the server sends a path challenge four path N with a four tuple, and then receives a path message from the client with a different 4 tuple, it consider its initial challenge as lost and only responds to the client's message.\r\n\r\nSo, I have a question: bite the complexity of 2 parallel path identifier sequences; or, simply add a \"collisions\" rule. What do people think?\r\n\r\n\r\ninitial_max_stream_data_bidi_local\r\ninitial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote",

          "body": "To give a bit more detail: active_connection_id_limit controls the maximum number of CIDs to ensure that the other end cannot force you to allocate a huge amount of memory to store the CIDs. This is still the same with use of a path ID; the only thing that is different is that you have to store a path ID in addition to the CID. However, controlling the max number of CIDs is still the way to control how much memory needs to be allocated.\r\n\r\nAdditional path state beyond the CIDs only need to be created when a path is actually opened. An endpoint needs to also control the maximum number of open paths, however, first of all active_connection_id_limit give a maximum for that as well and second when the same path ID is used in both direction each endpoint can control the number of maximum path  individually without the need to communicate this to the other end by not issuing more path IDs.\r\n\r\nIn practice we should recommend that each endpoint locally decides how many paths it is willing to maintain at max and then we recommend to set the active_connection_id_limit parameter to local_max_path * 2 to still allow for migration on each path. Similarly the other end can look at the active_connection_id_limit parameter from the other peer and issue at least active_connection_id_limit/2 path ID if its own local limit allows that.\r\n\r\nAbout @MikeBishop point, I don't think it's really needed to control the active_connection_id_limit value very tightly. It's more important to have a limit at all. So if you select a value for multipath support and only get single path, you might get more CIDs then you need to but its the same amount of ressources you committed to. I don't think that is really a problem.\r\n\r\nNote that in this case it would maybe also make sense to maintain only one sequence number space for all CIDs instead of per path. This question can be decided independently, even though it supports the same idea, I opened issue #371 for the this.\r\n",

We've already discussed this issue in PR #292 and I'd like to provide more details about this issue: \r\n\r\n1. The whole explicit path ID design require the CID's sequence number to be generated under per path(instead of generated for the whole connection in RFC9000), the Retire Prior To is also used for per path as part of the corresponding mechanism, or the core design is not able to work.\r\n2. The transport parameter _active_connection_id_limit_ describe the limit of active connection IDs for connection in RFC 9000, it's nature to transmit the limit for per path as we changed the CID allocation for per path.\r\n3. If the _active_connection_id_limit_ is still for the whole connection, there could be terrible situations that endpoints used too much CIDs on the previous paths, and don't have enough CID(s) for creating the new path. It could cause the CID allocation strategy to be more complicated.\r\n4. Although we could set the  _active_connection_id_limit_ as (_active_connection_id_limit_per_path_ * path_num), but it would be easy for attackers to generate more CIDs under one single path and try to force the peer to allocate more unnecessary memory.\r\n\r\nOn conclusion, it's simple and clear to use the TP active_connection_id_limit for per path. We could add more editorial texts to explain this part of design if needed.\r\n\r\n ",

When endpoints advertise a Max Path value, they authorize the peer to send the authorized maximum number of active connection IDs for all the newly allowed paths. The peer may advertise that many Connection IDs, and the local endpoint has to be ready to store them all.\r\n\r\nThe number of paths is limited by the Max Path value, but is also gated by the availability of connection identifiers.

Presumably the recipient ignores the incoming packets and the connection eventually times out for both sides if the peer can no longer use the original path.\r\n\r\nHowever, that doesn't match the text in multipath. On the contrary, \"On receiving a PATH_CHALLENGE frame, an endpoint MUST respond by echoing the data contained in the PATH_CHALLENGE frame in a PATH_RESPONSE frame.\"\r\n\r\nSo I interpret this as a two-step process:\r\n\r\n- Upon receipt of a packet which matches a connection but is from/to an unexpected address, the server decides whether it is willing to process the packet. If not, the packet is dropped.\r\n  - See also 5.2, \"Packets that are matched to an existing connection are discarded if the packets are inconsistent with the state of that connection.\"\r\n- Only after processing the packet will it know what frames are inside.

Not sending data on the path implicitly means that the endpoint will not use any of the MP_NEW_CID sent by the peer for the abandoned path. De facto, that's equivalent to retiring these CIDs: they will not be used anymore. Sending explicit MP_RETIRE_CID is just overhead, or maybe worse than overhead.\r\n\r\nIn monopath QUIC, sending a RETIRE_CID is useful because it can trigger production by the peer of a NEW_CID. But in the PATH_ABANDON scenario, there is no point: if the peer produced more MP_NEW_CID frames, they will just be unused. Since there is no point, some implementations may be tempted to not do it. The endpoint could just silently drop the unused CID, and would not suffer any consequence. The peer, on the other hand, will be stuck with a list of \"zombie CID\" that have no utility and just consume memory. So, if we look at the endpoint that receives the path Abandon, its interest is to free resource asap, whether MP_RETIRE_CID frames are received after the path Abandon or not.\r\n\r\nThe main synchronization issue is the \"stateless reset\" risk. When an endpoint sends a PATH ABANDON, there maybe some packets in transit that will be delivered out of order. If the peer has deleted all knowledge of the path-associated CID, the CID in the out of order packets will not be recognized, and the peer will send a \"stateless reset\" packet.\r\n\r\nWe could specify a complex solution to eliminate the stateless reset risk, such as ask to retain knowledge of the old CID for 3*PTO after receiving the PATH_ABANDON. That will reduce the risk of generating stateless reset packets, but it will not eliminate it. But then, stateless reset packets only have an effect if they can be verified, if the last 16 bytes match the \"Stateless Reset Token\" of a valid CID for the connection. If the sender of the path abandon has freed all resource associated with the CIDs for the abandoned path-ID, it will also have deleted the corresponding stateless reset tokens. The stateless reset packet sent by the peer thus will not be recognized as a valid stateless reset, and will have no effect on the state of the connection.\r\n\r\nThus, I think that the proper behavior should be:\r\n\r\n1) When sending a path abandon frame, immediately free the resource associated with the CIDs received from the peer for that path.\r\n\r\n2) When receiving a path abandon frame, assume that it carries an implicit \"retire CID\" for all the CIDs sent to the peer, and free the corresponding resource after a short delay, maybe 3*PTO.",

One simple way to do that is to include the server ID in the content of the CID. Doing that in clear text is risky, because leaking the server ID allows some tracking of connections across CID, and also enables DDOS of specific servers in the farm. The norm is to encrypt it, but encryption keys will need to be rotated, and when we do that whole batches of CID have to be retired.

The main reasons to clear a batch of CIDs in a farm is the closing of the path, but if we want fewer messages we can just make that implicit with \"path abandon\".\r\n\r\nWe already have global constraints for connection ID: they must be unique for the whole connection, in fact for the whole set of connections sharing a UDP port.

Or we do nothing here because you can really enforce a certain congestion control behavior and effectively anybody could just multiple the cwnd by some factor even with only one path.\r\n\r\nAlso note that if we want to only allow for one path per 4-tuple, we would probably need to describe a way to enforce that by either ignoring an path validation attempt or actively closing one of the two paths.",

The only other case where you ignore the path challenge/packet with a certain path ID is when the path ID is larger than the max path ID.

I.e. I think there is nothing wrong to keep a path open without using it, then if your actively-used path fails, you switch over to that path. If that is then also not working, you can try to establish another path or close the connection. If you think it's likely that your standby path will break, of course it can make sense to actively probe liveliness to avoid delays when you later actually try to use that path.

We could say the first one differently, and treat the decision to abandon paths after timeout as a local behavior.

If you only have a single path and it breaks, you have to close it at some pre-agreed time because you can't communicate something else to the other peer anymore. However, in the multipath case as long as you still have at least one working path, there is actual no really good reason to force the close by an timeout because any peer can at any time gratefully close the path by sending an abandon frame on another path. \r\n\r\nThis can be useful if e.g. an interface goes down but comes back after a short time. Of course you have to remember that a path is currently not working and somehow recognise when it's up again (by probing it?). But not sure we need to specify much here.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I think it would probably make sense to have different timeout for the connection and for (sub-)paths and we could revisit that question. But not enforcing anything and just leaving it as local decision is the easiest.\r\n\r\nOn your text above: If the peer keeps sending keep-alive traffic and the endpoint receiving and acknowledging it, then there should never be a time-out no?\r\n\r\nMaybe there are cases where an endpoint could decide to close a path that is only used for keep-alive traffic but that's a different case that we maybe should discuss separately (in the implementation considerations section?).",

The idle timeout informs the peer of the minimum frequency at which it needs to send keep-alive traffic if it wishes to do so.\r\n\r\nSo the scenarios I think we care about for multipath:\r\n\r\n- If I want to keep a standby path alive, how frequently should I send keep-alive traffic?\r\n- When I go to send data, how are timed-out paths considered?\r\n- If I decide to let the entire multipath connection idle-close, at what point does that happen?\r\n\r\nThe normative text in #389 is unnecessary; endpoints don't need permission to close a path based on idle timeout, since they can explicitly close a path at any time for any reason. The existing statement that this reason still requires a PATH_ABANDON is sound.\r\n\r\nRather, I think what we need is guidance on the most productive behavior. I think that would be:\r\n\r\n- On any path you want to keep active, SHOULD send keep-alives based on the indicated timeouts.\r\n- If you don't do keep-alives, you SHOULD probe the path before using it unless it's the only remaining path.\r\n- If you are about to send traffic, you SHOULD send on a path that has not timed out.\r\n- Idle timeout is just like any other reason for closing a path; you MUST send a PATH_ABANDON on another path\r\n  - ...though perhaps not immediately, to avoid waking radios.

          "body": "@MikeBishop it took me a bit of time to understand what \"normative text in #389\" you were speaking about, but I believe you are speaking of:\r\n~~~\r\nWhen more than one path is available, hosts shall monitor the arrival of\r\npackets and acknowledgements for packets sent over each\r\npath. Hosts MAY consider closing a path if for at least the period of the\r\nidle timeout as specified in {{Section 10.1. of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}\r\n(a) no packet was received or (b) no packet sent over this path was acknowledged.\r\nEndpoints that desire to close a path because of the idle timer rule\r\nrule if it would disqualify all available paths.\r\nMUST do so explicitly by sending a PATH_ABANDON frame on another active path,\r\nas defined in {{path-close}}.\r\n~~~\r\nThere are two normative statements there, MAY (close a path), and MUST (send an explicit PATH ABANDON). There is also a pseudo normative one, shall monitor. I think that the paragraph does many things:\r\n\r\n* specify that endpoints shall monitor the paths. I am not sure about that. No interop issue arises if the endpoint does not.\r\n* say that endpoints MAY close a path because of timeouts, \r\n* remove the distinction between probing packets and non probing packets. \r\n* specify that if endpoints want to close a path upon timeout, they should use the same \"idle timeout\" defined for the connection, which implicitly tells endpoints \"how frequently they should send keep-alive traffic\".\r\n* specify that endpoints MUST send PATH ABANDON frames if they close because of timeout, which is kind of redundant but clearly specify that we not use the \"silent close\" process of RFC 9000.\r\n\r\nI agree that the MAY close is a bit redundant, but I think it is important to have it to introduce the discussion of the other points. I would personally suggest striking out the first sentence of the paragraph, \"shall monitor\". And maybe belabor the \"same timeout\" point a bit more, because that does have interop consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However, sending keep-alive requires to wake up the radio every time and therefore is exactly the thing I want to avoid. \r\n\r\nWithout multipath if there is only one actively path, you need to define a clear point of time, so both endpoint close down if the path doesn't work anymore. that is not needed with multipath because you always send an explicit signal (PATH_ABANDON) on another path. With PR #377 and some other changes we are much more clear now in the draft that's always better to send a explicit signal and there is basically no reason to do an implicit close (except for the last path and therefore the whole connection).\r\n\r\nOf course if you have an open path and you don't send keep-alives the path can be broken we you try to use it again, however, I think it depends on your local knowledge if you think sending keep-alives will help or is just a waste of resources.

(And of course, if my assumptions are wrong, I'll happily learn better.)\r\n\r\nI'm assuming that sending the PATH_ABANDON requires waking up _some_ radio. That's why I think we should explicitly allow sending it to be deferred until you're sending a packet anyway; if the other path is actively being used, that's still immediate. If it's not, you avoid waking up any idle radios.\r\n\r\nI also think we're in agreement about keep-alives -- base QUIC recommends sending keep-alives if you actively want to maintain the connection, but leaves it to the application to decide when that is. HTTP/3 gives some recommendations about when that might be, but still leaves it as an implementation decision. Nothing needs to require keeping any specific path alive, but guidance about when it might be useful (or not) seems appropriate.\r\n\r\n> An endpoint might need to send ack-eliciting packets to avoid an idle timeout if it is expecting response data but does not have or is unable to send application data.\r\n\r\n> HTTP clients are expected to request that the transport keep connections open while there are responses outstanding for requests or server pushes",

You can just not implement that for connection close as you'll close the connection anyway but for other frames that's probably something to avoid (and use error codes instead). However, note that if we remove the reason phrase we don't have any way anymore to communication any reason from the application why it decided to close a path.\r\n\r\nFurther, if we have an error code we could probably also add another error code for \"unstable_interface\" or something like this. Thinking more about this we could probably also add another code for \"no_CID_available\" (even thought not sure here because that might actually be a real error to close the connection?). These ones could actually be useful for the receiver to decide if it tries to re-open the path or not.\r\n\r\nFor me right now, the two possible ways forward are:\r\n1) remove the error code (and reason phrase?)\r\n2) define a new QUIC code space\r\n\r\nJust for the sake of completeness the other two options discussed in the last session were:\r\n3) add additional QUIC error codes (and restrict use in the abandon frame to a limited set?)\r\n4) add an application layer error code instead\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

But it also includes expected behaviours that are not errors, such as when an endpoint cancels a request (a bit like path abandon) by sending a REST_STREAM or STOP_SENDING using H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases, a compliant H3 implementation abides to these requirements:\r\n\r\n> Although the reasons for closing streams and connections are called \"errors\", these actions do not necessarily indicate a problem with the connection or either implementation. For example, a stream can be reset if the requested resource is no longer needed.\r\n> \r\n> An endpoint MAY choose to treat a stream error as a connection error under certain circumstances, closing the entire connection in response to a condition on a single stream. Implementations need to consider the impact on outstanding requests before making this choice.\r\n> \r\n> Because new error codes can be defined without negotiation (see [Section 9](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114#extensions)), use of an error code in an unexpected context or receipt of an unknown error code MUST be treated as equivalent to [H3_NO_ERROR](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114#H3_NO_ERROR). However, closing a stream can have other effects regardless of the error code; for example, see [Section 4.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114#request-response).\r\n\r\nAs a recipent, an H3 implementation has to be prepated for a peer to use \"the wrong\" error code space (send a transport error when it was an application error), or send a generic code, or send an incorrect code. I don't think any of those cause any real problems for the recipient, it's mainly for debugging. And someone investigating these should always be skeptical of the peer not telling the ground truth.\r\n\r\nOn balance, I think having some error code is useful and its fine to use the QUIC error code space. This is an example of an extension where we are building some more complexity into the transport and can expect to need to extend the shared codepoint space to suit.\r\n\r\nHaving the frame use values in a unique error code space is also a possibility. But then you'll want to create a separate registry for that. And it doesn't stop the peer sending any allowable value on the wire.\r\n\r\n> 4) add an application layer error code instead\r\n\r\nI not 100% sure what this means. If the suggestion is to use e.g. HTTP/3 application error space I don't think that works. If its more like \"allow applications to define their own means to communicate the reason a path was abandoned, such as a new application-layer message\" then maybe but it seems like a pain when we can solve a problem transport in transport.

The proposal was to use application error code similar as in RESET_STREAM but also to reserve code 0 for QUIC layer path abandon. Especially the last part (reserving 0) was rejected, so if we would want to do that, we would need to define two frame types instead. Further it was argued that there usually is no reason for the application to close a path (other then with stream reset). I'm not sure about this argument: I would assume opening a new path is usually trigger by the application (in case of H3, I don't think it would be the H3 layer but the application on top using H3) and as such I'd assume closing a path might also be trigger by the application. It was further made the argument that having such an application interaction means you can't use multipath without changing the application. I believe we want to support are both cases where you can have logic in the QUIC stack to manage paths but also where the application maybe wants tighter control. So at the moment, I'm still not fully convinced that an application error code would not be useful.\r\n\r\n",

I guess if debugging is the main reason to have this error code at all, this could be useful? At least the argument was made that error codes are cheap and therefore it looks like we should keep it.\r\n2) During the meeting another case was proposed for problems with the interface. Should we add a separate error code for INSTABLE_INTERFACE? It was also mentioned in the session at IETF-120 that this error code could actually be useful to indicate to the peer to not retry. So I guess this goes beyond debugging then.

So we should clearly state that the Section 8 requirements for migration also apply to new path creation. I think it's fine for that to live in 10.2 and just be a little more explicit.\r\n\r\nBut I think we do implementers a disservice if we don't call out those requirements in context, specifically in Section 3.1:\r\n\r\n- We already require that Path Initiation perform Address Validation by sending a PATH_CHALLENGE; RFC 9000 requires packets containing PATH_CHALLENGE to be expanded to at least 1200 bytes. Let's add a sentence highlighting that requirement and referencing Section 8.2.1 of RFC 9000. (While I think expanding more packets in that first RTT might be beneficial, I can live with not requiring anything more.)\r\n- Similarly, highlight that upon receiving a new path from an unvalidated address, the server will need to respect the anti-amplification limits from Section 8 of RFC 9000 and point there for more details.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I think it's perfectly reasonable not to double-specify; I'd just like us to point to RFC9000 with a reminder of existing requirements to help people find them.

Multipath QUIC enhances performance by utilizing multiple paths simultaneously, but it currently lacks mechanisms to guarantee data delivery within specific timeframes. Introducing deadline-aware streams to Multipath QUIC could enable applications to meet stringent latency constraints, optimizing for low-latency and high-reliability scenarios.\r\nAdditionally, the ability to have multiple paths using the same 4-tuple opens up the possibility of leveraging paths from path-aware networks like SCION, source routing, and others. This expands the pool of available paths beyond traditional IPv4 and IPv6 routes, potentially increasing the effectiveness of deadline-aware mechanisms like those proposed in DMTP.\r\n\r\n#### Relevant Discussion\r\n\r\nIn a recent discussion around the Multipath Extension for QUIC ([Issue #378](https://github.com/quicwg/multipath/issues/378)), the use of multiple paths with the same 4-tuple found support. This aligns with the idea of integrating paths from path-aware networks, enabling Multipath QUIC to utilize all available paths provided by the system.\r\n\r\n### How DMTP Fits In\r\n\r\nThe Deadline-aware Multipath Transport Protocol (DMTP) is tailored for deadline-sensitive communication over multiple paths. It employs strategies like smart retransmissions and Forward Error Correction (FEC) to optimize packet delivery based on latency deadlines, ensuring retransmissions occur only when they are likely to meet these deadlines. These methods align well with Multipath QUIC's capabilities, potentially allowing for efficient and reliable deadline-aware data transmission across different network paths.\r\n\r\n### Key Concepts of DMTP\r\n\r\n- Path Optimization: DMTP dynamically selects paths based on metrics like latency, bandwidth, and packet loss. This approach complements Multipath QUIC's ability to manage multiple paths effectively.\r\n- Adaptive FEC: By integrating FEC, DMTP reduces the need for retransmissions, proactively adding redundancy when random losses are detected. This could enhance Multipath QUIC's congestion control mechanisms.\r\n- Smart Retransmissions: DMTP only retransmits packets if they are predicted to meet the deadline, which helps to avoid unnecessary retransmissions. Incorporating this into QUIC's scheduling could improve overall efficiency.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed information on DMTP, please refer to our [paper](https://doi.org/10.23919/IFIPNetworking57963.2023.10186417).\r\nWe have developed a prototype implementation of DMTP, which we plan to open-source in the near future.\r\n\r\n### How to get it integrated into Multipath QUIC\r\n\r\nTo integrate DMTP into Multipath QUIC, we propose implementing DMTP's mechanisms as a custom scheduler and congestion controller within the Multipath QUIC framework. Additionally, we suggest introducing a new transport parameter to signal support for deadline-aware streams during the handshake. For incorporating deadline information into data transmission, our proposal is to define an additional extension frame type called DEADLINE_CONTROL. The aim of this frame is to signal deadline-awareness for specific streams and indicate their associated deadlines.\r\n\r\n### Request for Feedback\r\n\r\nWe're considering integrating deadline-aware streaming concepts from DMTP into Multipath QUIC and are interested in the community's perspective. Do you see value in this exploration? Are there potential challenges or compatibility concerns we should be aware of? Your feedback will be instrumental in guiding this proposal.",

It is about not having an infinite cycle of sending an ACK, receiving an ACK in return, ACKing that, etc.\r\n\r\nThe issue that you describe is also happening in asymmetric links, without using multipath. If the return path is too narrow, it could be congested by too many ACKs. RFC 9000 is silent about that, largely because previous attempts at congestion control of acknowledgements have been \"inconclusive\". Since ACKs are not immediately acknowledged, the congestion control loop is very loose, and thus very imprecise. You can easily reach a state where congestion control slows the sending of ACKs, which in turn slows the sending of data, etc.\r\n\r\nIn uni-path scenarios, the best protection against swamping the return path is to control ACK Frequency, which limits the number of ACKs sent per RTT. The big problem there is that the ACK Frequency draft does not mention multipath. It is probably too late to change that draft, so maybe we should write a companion draft, \"ACK Frequency for Multipath\". Basically, define a PATH_ACK_FREQUENCY frame similar to ACK Frequency but with a Path ID.",

In that case, an endpoint MUST NOT send an ack-eliciting frame in all packets that would otherwise be non-ack-eliciting, to avoid an infinite feedback loop of acknowledgments._\r\n\r\nThe spec does mention congestion control, as you said: _Since packets containing only ACK frames are not congestion controlled, an endpoint MUST NOT send more than one such packet in response to receiving an ack-eliciting packet_. That mean that if a node receives just one packet, it should send at most one ACK for that specific packet. It also implies that if you receive 2 or 3 packets, it is fine to send 2 or 3 ACKs. For example, if a node receives packets 1 and 2, it would be perfectly fine to send ACK 1-2 on path 1, and a copy of ACK 1-2 on path 2. Which would not address our problem, \"avoid saturating a narrow return path\".\r\n\r\nThe solution really is to send fewer ACKs overall, and that means adapting the ACK FREQUENCY draft for multipath.",

Nothing in the spec prevents you from optimising these corner cases. However, these are all the things where we don't know how this is used and we therefore cannot and should not say more.",

After that, **A** continues to acknowledge incoming packets from **B**, on the same or another path.\r\n3. **B** receives and acknowledges the packet with the `PATH_ABANDON` frame.

When all of **B**'s packets in flight have been acknowledged, or the tail loss probe timer has expired, it send the `PATH_ABANDON` to **A** and removes all state is has for the path.\r\n5.

As usually all packets sent before the PATH_ABANDON will receive before the PATH_ABANDON and therefore will be ACKed, there is no need to wait for the ACKs first. If there is re-ordering, that's why we have the 3 PTO waiting time. Also note that when you try to wait for the ACKs first, you also need a 3 PTO timer as they might never arrive.

When **A** then receives the `PATH_ABANDON`, it can directly delete all state for the path instead of waiting for 3PTO.\r\n\r\nForcing **B** to immediately send a `PATH_ABANDON` frame is pointless, it adds not information since **A** will anyway get an acknowledgment that the `PATH_ABANDON` frame it sent has been received.\r\n\r\n### Sending in-path acknowledgments after having sent PATH_ABANDON\r\n\r\nSection 3.3 (Path Close) says:\r\n> The current draft does not allow sending acknowledgments for incoming packets on the same path after a PATH_ABANDON frame has been sent.\r\n\r\nWhy is this?

Currently, we have a very deterministic logic:\r\n\r\n- identify the path by the path ID of the incoming packet.\r\n- if the path ID was not seen yet, this is a new path.\r\n- if the path ID exists already:\r\n- if the 4 tuple match, and the CID match, no problem.\r\n- if the CID is new, rotate the local CID\r\n- if the 4 tuple does not match, treat that has a NAT traversal, challenge the old and the new address, retains the one for which the challenge works.\r\n\r\nThe \"path migration\" scenario breaks that logic. The CID is new, but it should not be rotated. Traffic should continue with the old CID, as in classic 9000. The server should only try to validate the new 4-tuple, not the old one. We have to reintroduce the concept of path-validating frames. We have to distinguish between NAT rebinding an migration by checking whether the CID is new, but we selected the unique-path-id architecture precisely because we know we cannot do that reliably.\r\n\r\nInstead of attempting path migration of an existing path, applications have a much better solution: just create a new path with the new 4 tuple, and then abandon the old path after validating the new one. This gives us a safe migration.\r\n\r\nDuring the interop testing, picoquic was reacting poorly to the migration attempt. I think I fixed that by simply ignoring any path challenge received on a different 4 tuple on an existing path. That means falling back to the NAT traversal code if someone attempts a \"path migration\". It will probably move the confusion to the implementation that is attempting these migrations, which I believe is fair since they should not be doing that in the first place.",

See also the old issue #188.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that there are four possible events:  CID rotation, NAT rebinding, NAT rebinding with simultaneous CID rotation, and migration. I wrote a summary of scenario in the following table, in which:\r\n\r\n* Observation is what the peer sees: CID, which in all cases  point to the same path ID, and 4-tuple\r\n* Whether verification is needed or not.\r\n* What to do if verification fails.\r\n\r\nThe results for the peer are:\r\n\r\nEvent | Observation | Verification needed | If verification fails\r\n-------|--------------|-----------------------|----------\r\nCID rotation | Different CID, same 4-tuple | No | Cannot fail\r\nNAT rebinding | Same CID, same 4-tuple | Yes | retain old 4 tuple\r\nNAT rebinding with simultaneous CID rotation | Different CID, different 4-tuple | Yes | retain old 4 tuple, use new CID\r\nMigration | Different CID, different 4-tuple | Yes | retain old 4 tuple, use old CID (per RFC 9000).

Suppose that there is a gap in traffic, a few seconds of silence. The longer the silence, the higher the probability that a NAT rebinding happen. But for privacy reasons, many stacks perform a CID rotation after a long silence. It is very likely that many NAT rebinding will also be associated with CID rotation.\r\n\r\nWe have an ambiguity between two scenarios that present the same symptoms to the peer, yet require a different handling. The best way to solve that ambiguity is to never use path migration, and always treat arrival of a new four tuple as a NAT rebinding, whatever the value of the CID.\r\n",

The multipath mechanisms allow \"make before break\", using PATH_AVAILABLE and PATH_BACKUP frames to control where to send traffic, and PATH_ABANDON to cleanly \"break\" one path after other paths are available.\r\n\r\n2) Add some text explaining that we do have some ambiguity in RFC 9000 between the \"uncontrolled\" NAT Rebinding scenario and the \"controlled\" migration scenarios. This ambiguity can be resolved using heuristics, but the heuristics will get confused some time. Implementations that do not want to rely on these heuristics can simplify their code by only supporting the NAT Rebinding scenario. This will drop support for scenarios like \"prepare a migration, validate the continuity of the 4-tuple, then keep the 4-tuple in standby until the app decides to use it\" -- NAT Rebinding only does immediate migration, if the old path is still available, the new attempt is discarded.",

Use of the \"preferred address\" is considered as a migration event that does not change the Path ID.\"_ This point is further reinforced in the path management section: _\"In particular, if the server uses the preferred_address transport parameter, clients cannot assume that the initial server address and the addresses contained in this parameter can be simultaneously used for multipath (Section 9.6.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).\"_\r\n\r\nThis is questionable, since support of RFC-9000 style \"migration\" is problematic, as explained in issue #458. With multipath negotiated, \"path migration\" uses the same code path as \"NAT Rebinding\", which is a poor fit for preferred address migration. The selected path will eventually depend on the order in which packets are received, which might bring back usage of the original address instead of the preferred address. \r\n\r\nClients will get a much more reliable result if they proceed in two steps: first establish a new path to the preferred address (typically path id 1), then abandon the initial path (path id 0). This is the \"make before break\" scenario that should generally be preferred to path migration. But this behavior is gated by two conditions: the server should allow a \"max path id\" value no lower than 1; and, the server shall provide the client with connection IDs for path 1. Otherwise, the client will have to wait until the server sends a new MAX_PATH_ID and PATH_CONNECTION_ID frames.\r\n\r\nWe may want to revise the text to explicitly authorize \"make before break\" behavior, i.e., using path creation instead of path migration for handling the preferred address. If we don't do that, stacks would probably need a special handling of the preferred address, as an exception to the normal code behavior, and that special handling should probably be discussed in the implementation section.",

And yes, in that case that means deleting path 0. But given what we have written, we can have server implementations that delay providing CID for path 1 until migration of path 0 to the preferred address is complete. Combine that with a stubborn client that does not do migration, and we have an interop problem.\r\n\r\nI guess part of the issue is that I treated the old \"migration\" code as \"creating a path\". It does something else, merely validating a 4 tuple. The path creation only happens in RFC 9000 when the client actually migrates a path to a new tuple -- a different concept than what we do with path creation. I don't have time to fix that immediately, but should be able to review it in December.\r\n\r\nBut then, RFC 9000 migration relies on the concept of \"path validating frames\". I hoped I could get rid of that.\r\n\r\nLooking at it that way opens interesting possibilities. For example, I could do an address validation exchange using a CID allocated for path X, then use the validated address to immediately send data on a new path Y, then close the unrelated path Z.

Also we should maybe consider to reserve path ID 1 than only for the preferred address to avoid ambiguity but that seems a bit ugly, too.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I don't think we should take on another such design change if there is not really an unsolved problem that needs fixing or otherwise things don't work.

More complicated than 1 because you need to track ACKs, and same fragility.\r\n\r\n3) Do nothing. After all, the only effect of having a path lingering in limbo is to reduce the number of path-id available for path creation. If you don't need to create a new path, there is no real issue. This is the option with the least side effects.\r\n\r\n4) Put the path in some explicit limbo state after the Abandon is acked or after a short timer. In that state, drop all incoming packets, never ack them. Kinda like doing nothing, but with fewer resource allocated locally.",

The 62 bits of the reconstructed QUIC packet number in network byte order are left-padded with zeros to the size of the IV.

So per RFC 9001 Section 5.1 the IV is derived using a key derivation function using the label \"quic iv\".

In TLS 1.3, the HKDF-Expand-Label\n   function described in Section 7.1 of [TLS13] is used with the hash\n   function from the negotiated cipher suite.  All uses of HKDF-Expand-\n   Label in QUIC use a zero-length Context.`\n\nThe IV length appears cipher dependent, thus it is possible that if one would arrive at a cipher that has an IV that is shorter than 96 bits the behavior is undefined. However, I agree that the text I complained about is necessary to define the behavior when the IV is longer than 96-bits so the path+pn is defined in those cases. \n",

(see above)\n- No changes on frames and error codes\n- Implementation considerations moved further to the back after frames and error codes (but this is optional; we can also keep it where it is now but I thought we have all normative things first)\n- no review of the structure of the implementation considerations section was done yet; this will follow later\n\n\nAlso note that I already created a first editorial PR for the intro. However, we might first want to land all other PRs and submit another revision and then start the rest of the editorial work.",

Also there is no really good reason to not just provide at least one CID for all paths up to the max path id limit. If you want to limit the number of paths, just set a lower max path id limit. This could be clarified in the draft.\n\nHowever, the use case to send PATH_CIDS_BLOCKED frame when you want to open a new path but are not blocked by the max path id but instead by the fact that you didn't get any CID for an unused path ID seemed still relevant as this behaviour is allowed and therefore might not be an implementation error.\n\nAlso as we have now already specified it, there is no real harm in keeping it.

It is not required to send a PATH_ABANDON frame at any specific point in time.  For example, an endpoint may wait until it will anyway send another frame._\"\n\nSection 3.4 on \"Path Close\" says: \"_If a peer sends a PATH_ABANDON frame but never receives a corresponding PATH_ABANDON frame, it might not be able to remove path state. It is left to the implementation to handle this unexpected behavior as it does not impact interoperability. If the endpoint is no longer willing to process the issued connection IDs for the abandoned path, it MAY close the connection, but SHOULD wait at least 3 PTOs after sending the PATH_ABANDON frame._\"\n\nThe text in 3.3.3 is motivated in part by radio management. On a mobile device, sending any packet requires powering up the radio, which consumes energy. It is better to power the radio once and send a few packets in a batch than to power the radio multiple time. But if the endpoint waits until \"something else has to be sent\", it may wait more than 3*PTO, and the peer MAY close the connection. Not good.",

      "body": "During my read-through of the document, I had the following comments. These are generally editorial. This is for draft-ietf-quic-multipath-14.\n\n### Section 1\n\n\"4-tuple\" is used without being directly defined, and I don't think that term is used in RFC 9000. Having a simple explanation of what tuple you mean would be good for people who aren't familiar. This is also used in section 5.2.\n\n> There are currently no IETF specifications for simultaneously (concurrently) using multiple paths.\n\nI think this would be more clear to explain that \"There are currently no IETF specifications _that define scheduling algorithms_ for...\". Without that clarification, it could sound like the IETF specifications prohibit simultaneous use (which isn't true) instead of just not specifying the algorithms for how to schedule them.\n\nThe intro defines the notion of \"path ID\" as part of the body of text, but it might be nice to have a separate sub-section that defines the normative aspects of the path ID. Right now, very crucial details about the path ID being an integer that monotonically increases, isn't reused, has special values for 0, etc, is mixed into the overview/conceptual text.\n\n### Section 2.1\n\n> When advertising the initial_max_path_id transport parameter, endpoints MUST use non-zero length Source and Destination Connection IDs.\n\nThe hyphens here feel a bit odd, like it should really be \"non-zero-length\". I suggest either one of these options:\n- \"endpoints MUST use Source and Destination Connection IDs with non-zero lengths.\"\n- \"endpoints MUST NOT use zero-length Source and Destination Connection IDs.\"\n\n### Section 2.3\n\n> The choice of three times the largest PTO is a trade-off.\n\nIt feels like this sentence should say \"is a trade-off between ___ and ___.\", for clarity.\n\n### Section 3\n\nThis is the first time that some of the new frame types are mentioned, such as `PATH_ABANDON`, `PATH_NEW_CONNECTION_ID`, `PATH_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID`. These don't consistently provide references to the sections where they are defined below. Please either add the references on these first uses, or maybe have an overview at the top of section 3 that mentions all of the new frame types and provides references at that point; or just move the frame definitions up.\n\n### Section 4.3\n\nI have a slight preference to change `PATH_BACKUP` -> `PATH_IS_BACKUP` or something similar. \"BACKUP\" alone sounds like a verb like \"ABANDON\", so initially I read it as \"back this path up\", which doesn't make much sense. A path _being_ a backup, like it can be available, makes more sense.\n\n### Section 4.2.1\n\nThe error codes defined here seem specific to paths, but they go in the main error registry. Should their names have more clear path-related names?\n\n`APPLICATION_ABANDON` -> `APPLICATION_ABANDON_PATH`\n`RESOURCE_LIMIT_REACHED` -> `PATH_RESOURCE_LIMIT_REACHED` (although this one seems it could be more generic)\n`UNSTABLE_INTERFACE` -> `PATH_UNSTABLE_INTERFACE`\n`NO_CID_AVAILABLE` -> `PATH_NO_CID_AVAILABLE` / `NO_CID_AVAILABLE_FOR_PATH`\n\n",

That path is already established, and can be used to send/receive the \"PATH_NEW_CONNECTION_ID\" frames. Then \"the path establishment continues on path 1\", with the exchange of PATH CHALLENGE and PATH RESPONSE.\n\nThe diagram is indeed a bit confusing. Saying that the packets are sent on path X (0 or 1) really means that the UDP packets are sent to two different 4 tuples for path 0 and path 1. But we did not include the UDP headers in the diagram. Probably we would want that.\n\nYou are concerned by the use of \"path ID = 1\" in the line:\n~~~\n1-RTT[]: PATH_NEW_CONNECTION_ID[C1, Seq=0, PathID=1] -->\n~~~\nThat actually OK, and demonstrates a valid point: the connection IDs have a value, a sequence number, and a path-ID. The connection IDs that will be sent on path 1 (and 2) need to have the corresponding value in the Path-ID attribute. They also need to be sent on path 0, before they are needed before we start using path 1. The text below the diagram says that. Suggestion for improvement?\n\nAll the frames are sent in 1RTT packets. Some are decorated with a sequence number, some are not. There is no actual requirement that the first packet sent on a path has sequence number 0 -- and even if there was, these packets can be resent with a different sequence number. Maybe we could drop these packet numbers, because casual readers may misinterpret them as related to path numbers. Or maybe we should document a sequence number in each packet, say using \"3\" for the packet sent on path 0, to illustrate that sequence numbers are per path.",

If you look at fairly typical address validation token in non-multipath QUIC, you can bind the client reflexive address to that token without spending any bytes by putting it in the AAD.  The client - if the token is remains current - will supply the address you need to validate the token when it connects.\n\nIf you have to allow for multiple addresses, that's no longer an option.  You have to add every valid address to the token explicitly, which means making it variable-length as well.  When addresses are 16 bytes each, that's a pretty significant increase.  More so if you consider that the server might want to encode additional per-address information, like CC, BDP, and RTT observations for each of those paths.\n\nThis also means that each token is much more powerful.  A server is expected to tolerate connections from any address in a set, rather than a single token.\n\nThe alternative is to make NEW_TOKEN path-specific.  That creates smaller and less powerful tokens.\n\nI don't recall seeing that discussion on the list; but I wasn't tracking it closely.  It would be good if some discussion of these trade-offs were included in the draft, and ideally some discussion of implementation strategies that might be necessary to achieve good outcomes or avoid bad outcomes.",

The client will receive several tokens. When considering using a token for subsequent connections, it might be difficult for the client to pick the \"right\" token among multiple tokens obtained in a previous connection. The client is likely to fall back to the strategy specified in [Section 8.1.3](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-8.1.3) of [[QUIC-TRANSPORT](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#QUIC-TRANSPORT)], i.e., pick the last received token. To avoid issues when clients make the \"wrong\" choice, a server SHOULD issue tokens that are capable of validating any of the previously validated addresses. Further guidance on token usage can be found in [Section 8.1.3](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-8.1.3) of [[QUIC-TRANSPORT](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#QUIC-TRANSPORT)].\n\nThis is pretty vague.  It says that the client is likely to pick the last.  But that doesn't work for multipath, because there are multiple paths active at any given time.  Questions to answer:\n\n* Can the client assume that the token is good for a connection attempt along any one of the paths that are currently active?\n* What needs to have happened for each path to be considered \"OK\"?  From the client's perspective as well as the server's.\n* What information should a client store for each token it receives, so that it can later use it and have a reasonable expectation that it works?\n* What information does a server need to store (either in the token or in a database keyed by the token) so that it can use the token if the client attempts to use it?\n* What might a client assume about addresses and paths that were validated, but are no longer in use?\n",

Consider the sequence:\n\n1. Client uses address A1 to connect to the server.\n2. Server provides token T1.\n3. Client uses address A2 for a new path.\n4. Server provides token T2.\n5. Client uses address A3  for a new path.\n6. Server provides token T3.\n7. Connection close\n8. Client opens a new connection, picks a source address and a token.\n\nWe can kinda predict the following:\n\n1. If client picks address A1, any of T1, T2, T3 will probably work.\n2. If client picks address A2, any of T2, T3 will probably work. Using T1 could cause a stateless retry, i.e., lose 1 RTT.\n3. If client picks address A3, only T3 will probably work. Using T1 or T2 could cause a stateless retry, i.e., lose 1 RTT.\n4. If the client address has changed and is now A4, none of the token will work.\n5.

The client could try to be smart, but is better off just picking the last token received on the connection. The last received token it also likely to remain valid longer.\n\nAnd then, if the client picks the wrong one, or wait too long, the connection should still work.

Maybe A3 is the most likely right now, A2 the most likely in 2 minutes, A1 the most likely as soon as the user is back home. That an address was used once makes it likely that it will be used again.

If all that is true, the client will pick the token that best matches its current IP address, and life will be good. But I am concerned that the hypotheses are not all valid. Leaving apart the increases resource necessary to store all these tokens, the big issue for me is whether the client knows its outgoing IP address. Consider:\n\n* Client behind a NAT: there is no guarantee that the NAT binding will not change between the two connections, and that the server will see the same IP address\n* Cellular network: if the client starts a new session, will it be assigned the same IP address?\n* Wi-Fi hot spot: the IP address will only stay the same for a \"session\" (DHCP or IPv6 address configuration).\n\nThese are not exactly new problems -- we have the same issues without multipath.

This is quoting something, but it doesn't correspond to any text elsewhere in the document. Maybe you could say this directly.

While that means retired connection IDs received from the peer cannot be used for sending anymore, packets from the peer might still be in transit. Therefore, knowledge of the connection IDs issued to the peer and of the state of the number space associated to the path SHOULD be retained for 3 PTO after the PATH_ABANDON frame has been received. This avoids generating spurious stateless reset packets, as discussed in [Section 3.4.2](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#spurious-stateless-reset), and helps acknowledge any potentially reordered, outstanding packets from the peer (see [Section 3.4.3](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#ack-after-abandon)).[\u00b6](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#section-3.4-4)\n\n\nThis is a SHOULD.

Given that a client is the only one that initiate paths, this seems like a pretty unrealistic scenario to begin with (#554 notwithstanding).

That is, amplification.\n\nThe request forgery risk with this protocol is almost exactly the same as QUIC[^1].  This is a difference that is not worth mentioning.\n\n[^1]: The addition of the path ID to the nonce has a miniscule impact.

However, that's unlikely to be the main factor anyway.\n\nWhat the text concerns itself with is amplification risk, which is not that interesting either.

It seems like there is no real guidance here.  There is a suggestion that an endpoint might limit its validation.  But that isn't really enough.\n\nIf paths share a bottleneck and path validation for 50 new paths would generate a spike in packets that hit that bottleneck in a way that it can't handle, we have a real problem.  I would have said that the only right thing to do is to have a stronger recommendation on the maximum number of paths that can be concurrently validated.  Setting that limit at one would be the obvious place to start.\n\nThis is not so much about amplification in the same sense we use in QUIC, because the number of inbound data would still need to reach one third of the outbound, but we also assumed in QUIC that path validation was below the baseline rate that a single link would be able to tolerate.  With multiple paths, that same assumption no longer holds.",

But instead, congestion overflow created by server traffic. Specifically, congestion overflow created by path management traffic from the server, which is not limited by the CC algorithm. We could probably add a section after 7.2 to describe that. \n\nThe first remedy would be to limit the number of paths available for path creation, i.e., do not increase the path-ID limit too fast -- same as suggested in 7.2. That should work for most applications, but some will need to rapidly probe multiple paths, e.g., P2P apps running a variation of ICE. The next limit may be some voluntary restriction on the volume of path response and challenge traffic in flight at a given time. For example, don't pad the response packets if there are multiple paths being probed at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The answer was yes, because we at least need to support migration of path 0 to the \"Preferred Address\". That being settled, we have two ways of achieving something like \"switch from Wi-Fi to 5G\":\n\n1. The RFC 9000 way: assuming path 0 is using WiFi, send another path challenge from the 5G interface, using a CID linked to path 0. If the challenge succeeds, the client update the 4 tuple used for path 0. The server notice \"non probing\" traffic coming from the new address, and thus also updates the 4 tuple used for path 0.\n\n2. The multipath way: send a path challenge from the 5G interface, using a CID linked to path 1. If the challenge succeeds, the client can send packets on both path 0 and path 1. If the client sets the status of path 1 to available, the server will send traffic on path 1. If the client abandons path 0, all the traffic moves to path 1.\n\nThe second way is much easier to manage -- it is a proper implementation of \"make before break\", and does not require making distinctions for probing packets. That's why it is encouraged. But endpoints may still need to support the old ways -- if only to support the \"Preferred Address\" feature -- and that means supporting the distinction between probing and non probing packet for these old style migrations.\n\nMaybe we can do a future version in which \"preferred address\" is implemented using multipath feature, and then stop supporting old style  migration. But that's for the future. ",

I understand that this concept is confusing, however, this is all part of RFC9000 and not this extension.\n\nI think we are both saying the same here?  An RFC9000-style migration requires a non-probing packet for the migration to happen.  Yet the current wording of \u00a7 3.1.2 says \"An endpoint could receive a packet with a CID [...] This MUST be treated as path migration, [...]\".\n\nThat however, suggests also a probing packet would be a path migration.  But it is only a non-probing packet that migrates the path.  Especially since the section referred to talks about receipt of a non-probing packet.\n\nPerhaps wording like this would be an improvement:\n\nProbing and non-probing packets received with a connection ID associated to an active path ID where the packet's 4-tuple does not match the 4-tuple currently used with that path ID, MUST be treated as path-probing and path migration as specified in {{Section 9 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.  Additionally all connection IDs used during such path migration MUST be associated with the current path ID of the path being migrated.",

It that case, in order to create a new path, a client sends a probe with a zero length CID. It arrives at the server on a five tuple that the server has not yet seen. How can the server know which encryption context it should use? The same issue would also happen in the case of NAT rebinding. The server sees a new five tuple, does not know what encryption to apply.\r\n\r\nSo, the first request is to specialize this text to the case in which the client uses zero length CID but the server does not.\r\n\r\nEven in that case, using the five tuple is going to make client-side encryption offload significantly more complex. The offload engines will have to remember all the five tuples used in the connection, and the corresponding keys. This is a new requirement, and it may be difficult to meet by many implementations.\r\n\r\nI think it would be much simpler to accept the limitation: using multiple number spaces requires that both sides use non-null connection IDs.",

The clarity part is a matter of taste; the subtle deviations need discussion.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, to process. Since the DPRIVE WG has not adopted a fully GitHub based process, the preferred method for requesting changes is by having a discussion on the WG mailing list. If we did adopt a GitHub based process, we should probably first migrate this depot to an IETF managed account. Then, we should make clear that discussions should start by opening an issue, not a pull request. Issues allow presentation of the problem before text changes and the archival of those discussions, pull requests are not designed for that. They should come later, when the issue has outlined a consensus for change.",

We have two cases.\r\n\r\n1. 1 sent on B, 2 sent on A\r\n\r\nThere are two sub-cases here.\r\n\r\n- The receiver sends an ACK before having received 2. `ACK(largest=1)` contains the ACK delay relative to path B. Then it receives 2, and sends `ACK(largest=2)` with ACK delay relative to path A. In this case, we have ACK delay for both paths.\r\n\r\n- The receiver waited for 2 before sending its ACK. Then, the ACK delay of `ACK(largest=2)` relates to path A, and we don't have the host delay of path B.\r\n\r\n2. 1 sent on A, 2 sent on B\r\n\r\nWhile we still have the two sub-cases, they both lead to the same result: `ACK(largest=2, missing=1)` and `ACK(largest=2)` have their ACK delay relative to the host delay of path B and not to the path A.\r\n\r\nIn general, if the largest packet number has been sent on the lowest latency path, it will prevent the receiver from advertising the host delay of higher latency paths. Note that the \"ideal case\" (where both paths have estimates) only works if the sender does not transmit further packets on the fast path, in which case we fall into case 2. As the fast path will get its packets acknowledged quicker, the sender will likely send further packets on fast path first. It might still be possible to get host delay estimates of slower paths, but most of the ACK delays will relate to the fast one.",

The new text essentially adds \"do not send if no non-probing packet received or acknowledged over 3 RTT.\" At first sight it looks right, but there is a tension. Suppose that, as a receiver, I wish the sender would stop sending on a path. With the old rule, I can simply stop sending on that path. With the new rule, I would have to also stop acknowledging packets, even if those packets were received correctly. That's not natural, a tension between signalling path preference and creating artificial losses. All considered, I would rather keep the old text.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that if I am a receiver that wants to proactively cause a sender to stop sending, I should use the explicit way of sending a path abandon frame. The idle timeout handles the case when a receiver is unaware of a path change that leads to communication failure. If that is the purpose, as long as the receiver can receive packets in the sender-to-receiver direction and acknowledge on another path, it looks to me that we should still allow the sender to use that path. But I feel if we do that, we are diverging from the bidirectional nature of a path described in the draft, which worths more discussion.",

This sentence covers the case where a path was idle for a while and therefore should be closed silently as it might not work anymore anyway. However, if you have received packet on the path or have an indication that packets you've sent on the path were received by the other end, the path is clearly not idle and working. I also agree with @yfmascgy that that means you only know for sure that the path is still working in one direction and that might need further discussion.",

          "body": "The old text was stating \"do not send if no non-probing packet received over 3 RTT\". The new text essentially adds \"do not send if no non-probing packet received or acknowledged over 3 RTT.\" At first sight it looks right, but there is a tension. Suppose that, as a receiver, I wish the sender would stop sending on a path. With the old rule, I can simply stop sending on that path. With the new rule, I would have to also stop acknowledging packets, even if those packets were received correctly. That's not natural, a tension between signalling path preference and creating artificial losses. All considered, I would rather keep the old text.",

We want to say that receiving data in one direction proves that the receiving direction works, and receiving acknowledgements proves that the sending direction works. Stop sending should logically be tied to the sending direction. If packets sent on a path are not acked, then the node should stop sending because the path is probably broken. But isn't that already covered? \r\n\r\nI think the text mixes two issues: stop sending because the path is broken; and, stop sending because the peer would rather not use it anymore. The peer not sending \"non probing\" data on the path may be an indication that it does not want to use it anymore. Or it may be an indication that it has nothing to send right now. Which means the signal is ambiguous, and using ambiguous signals is a bad idea. I think we should come down to two simple ideas:\r\n\r\n* nodes should monitor the quality of paths. If packets sent on the path are not acked, that means the quality is bad and the path should probably not be used.\r\n* nodes that want they peer to stop using a specific path should signal it using \"abandon path\" frame.",

Therefore please note that this PR proposes to add this text to the respective section for single PNS considerations. We can add more text about general ECN but that shouldn't be much different from normal QUIC operation and would be a separate PR for a different section of the document.  \r\n\r\n> Yes, in the case of single number space, that does mean single counter for all paths, and that makes the signal harder to use in congestion control.\r\n\r\nI don't think \"harder to use\" is right. If multiple packets from different paths are ack'ed in the same frame it's simply impossible to assign the signal to one path. As you never should just ignore a congestion signal, the most conservative but probably only correct reaction is unfortunately to reduce your cwnd on all paths where packet got ack'ed. \r\n\r\n> just not use ECN, i.e., send all packets with ECN flags \"00\".\r\n\r\nYes, that is an option and I can add this. This was actually my first thought (see my reply in issue #87). However, for me that would be a strong argument against the single PNS solution. But then I thought that if the receiver would send separate ACKs per path that could also address the problem and keeping ACKs separated per path (at least if the sender sends blocks of PNs on each path) might be beneficial anyway. I think that also something that Ian had in mind.\r\n\r\n> use ECN on only some path, e.g., the one path on which most data is sent, mark packets on this path with ECT-0 or ECT-1, mark packets on the other paths as \"00\".\r\n\r\nThat means you could only see ECN on one path. I don't think this an appropriate solution and again would be reason for me to not go for the single PNS solution.\r\n\r\n> use ECT-0 on one path, ECT-1 on the other, and use some logic to attribute ECN counts to either ECT-0 or ECT-1.\r\n\r\nI think this is out of scope for this document as it makes a different use of ECT1 against the recommendation in RFC8311 (and in conflict with L4S). So if you want to propose this, you have to go to tsvwg.\r\n\r\n> use ECT-0 or ECT-1 on all paths, and use correlation with other factors (e.g., losses, delays) to allocate the ECN marks to different paths.\r\n\r\nI don't think this could work. You don't have per packet delay information in the ACK, so that exactly the same ambiguity. And ideally loss should not be correlated with ECN - hopefully you have ECN instead of loss but that also not guaranteed as you might have multiple bottlenecks or other reason for loss.",

For example, when we want to use re-injection in our packet scheduling, we need to make sure that a packet sent on path 1 can also be reinjected on path 2. Therefore, what we did was to use per-path PMTU discovery and the use the minimum PMTU of all paths for each individual path. But indeed, this choice may vary in a different implementation.",

          "body": "There are two parts in this PR.\r\n\r\nFirst, the following sentences:\r\n\r\nThis extension does not change the definition of any transport parameter\r\ndefined in {{Section 18.2. of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. \r\nInline with the definition in {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} disable_active_migration\r\nalso disables multipath support, except \"after a client has acted on a\r\npreferred_address transport parameter\" {{Section 18.2. of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.\r\n\r\nThese sentences are at the right place. I would replace \"any\" by \"all the\" but that's a detail.\r\n\r\nFor the second part, I think that we should solve this problem differently. The current text is the following:\r\n\r\nFurther, it is out of scope for\r\nthis document if the old address can also be used for multipath\r\nafter a client has migrated to the address provided in the preferred_address\r\ntransport parameter. However, it SHOULD NOT be assumed that it is\r\npossible to use both addresses simultaneously without further confirmation\r\nfrom the other host.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to discuss somewhere in the document how the client learns the server address and how preferred address is used. Since we do not have a way for the server to convey the list of \"multipath-capable\" addresses in this document, I would suggest a simple approach:\r\n- When preferred address is not used, then the client can only establish multipath flows to the server address\r\n- When preferred address is used, then if a client migrates to one of the preferred addresses according to 9.6 of RFC9000, then it must consider this address as the endpoint of all multipath flows\r\n\r\nI guess that we'll need to define later a transport parameter that provides the list of \"multipath-capable\" addresses of a given server. In the mean time, we should opt for a simple solution.",

There are in fact two pieces to that: logic at the receiver, i.e., the node that chose to receive packets with zero-length CID; and logic at the sender, i.e., the node that accepts to send data on multiple paths towards a node that uses zero-length CID. This is explained in details in the section \"Using Zero-Length connection ID\", so I guess what we need is a reference to that section.",

The path_id_type field in the PATH_ABANDON frame is also added in the figure to give an idea how the type is used. Moreover, one case for single PN is added (where the client receives zero-length CID while the server receives long CID). According to previous discussion, in the single PN case, only the client needs to send out a PATH_ABANDON. The server SHOULD stop sending new data on the path indicated by the PATH_ABANDON frame after receiving it. However, The client may want to repeat the\r\nPATH_ABANDON frame if it sees the server continuing to send data. It is optional for the server to respond with a PATH_ABANDON after it receives a PATH_ABANDON frame from the client. ",

However, the problem is that in RFC9000 both ends don't need a common understanding of the path but now they do, so we need to address this. In our definition in this draft every 4-tuple is a different path and sticking to that makes it less complicated. The problem with NAT rebinding is that only one end see a new 4-tuple. As such we need an explicit signal to tell the other end to create a new path. I propose to simple use path validation for this (to keep change minimal).\r\n\r\nIf you are concerned about resetting the congestion window, we can say that the new path can be initialisierend with the cc values from the old path if only the source port changes.",

I guess if you receive the retired CID frame that means that the peer will not send any new packets but you can only be sure that there is no reordering if you received all packets before the packet with the retired CID frame, however, you don't really know how far back you have to look or there could be gaps introduced by the sender. So checking that is not really practical and always waiting for 3 PTOs is therefore just simpler. Or is there is strong reason why it would be needed to release resources on receipt of the retired CID frame already?\r\n\r\nI note that this discussion is also related to the question if we change the path ID with the CID or not. If we retire the path ID together with the CID, it makes more sense to act on the retired CID frame because in this case even if you receive reordered packets, you would not be able to process them as you don't have a valid path ID.",

In order word is an endpoint supposed to retire/forget the CID immediately when it received the retire CID frame and discard any packets with the old CID or might it also what 1-3 PTOs for re-order packet? I didn't find anything in RFC9000 but maybe somebody else that is better in finding this has a pointer to right part...?\r\n\r\nIf the former, meaning you remove it immediately and ignore old packets, that would also mean that you don't have a valid path ID anymore and can't process any ACKs or other control frame with the old path ID anymore. As such you also don't have to wait for 3 PTOs as you might receive packet/frames but can process them anymore. In this case (assuming that the path ID is connected to the CID), one solution could be to recommend to wait 3PTOs before you send the retired CID frame (or just accepting that this might happens and you have time retransmit some packets unnecessarily if you change the CID).\r\n\r\nIf you have a stable path ID, you can retire immediately and ignore packets with the old CID but still process any control frames that are received in packets with the new CID, and respectively have to wait 3 PTO before you can also remove the path id/close the path entirely.\r\n\r\nOr alternatively, you always have to 3 PTOs after the abandon frame before you remove any state including the last used CID but that also means that the retired CID frames doesn't have any impact. And it also means whenever you received a retired CID frame during an active path use, you also need to wait 3 PTOs before you remove it.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If that CID is forgotten, the load balancer or the QUIC server will not be able to associate it with a QUIC connection context. The QUIC connection will never have to process these packets.\r\n\r\nThe QUIC server will assume that the client is trying to use a connection that does not exist anymore and could issue a \"stateless reset\" packet, but since the CID has been retired the token in the stateless reset will not match any valid CID for the connection and will have no effect.\r\n\r\nWhich is a long winded way to say that packets arriving after the DCID has been retired will be automatically ignored.

In particular, there is well established practice of combining a high bandwidth long delay path through Geo satellite and a short delay low bandwidth terrestrial path, sending data on the wide path and sending ACK on the short path. Having a shorter control loop does improve performance, for example allowing the congestion window to ramp up twice faster during slow start. Similarly, sending ACK_MP on a reliable path results in better control than sending them on a lossy path results in more reliable control.\r\n\r\nI understand that the \"same path\" practice makes RTT computation easier, but that's only one aspect of the issue, IMHO not the most dominant aspect. In QUIC, most packet losses are detected by noticing that packets sent later on the path are already acknowledged, not by waiting on timers. Sending ACK_MP on a short path will enable faster detection of packet losses by acked number holes, while sending only on the \"return\" path only improve the computation of RTT, which may or may not improve timer-based recovery. (If ACK_MP are *always* sent on the shortest path, then measuring average and deviation of  ACK delays actually provide good input for loss detection timeout.)\r\n\r\nI think we do have an issue with getting good RTT estimates while not using time stamps. This could be fixed by requiring to also replicate some of the ACK_MP on the \"return\" path when possible, and by having implementation keep track of the progress of same path ACK.\r\n\r\nBut trying to mandate same path ACK just won't help, because implementation seeking better congestion control and better loss detection will just ignore the requirement.

Sending the ACK_MP on the same path is a reasonable default behaviour, but in some network configurations, this is clearly suboptimal and there is no point forcing endpoints to do that.

We already discuss the ACK_MP scheduling in implementation considerations, and that should be enough.

If we say anything, it will have to be \"the processing and update of the per path variables is specified in section so and so\", but I am not sure that helps. I would rather check in as is.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is also a longer answer. If the path did not change, the acknowledgement based loss detection (section 6.1 of RFC 9002) could take into account not just the number of \"posterior\" packets acknowledged with that old CID, but also the number of packets acknowledged in the \"new\" number space. That seems logical, but it implies that the acks for the \"old\" CID are not sent later than the acks for the \"new\" CID. This depends on implementation choices, and thus may not be reliable. We could have a discussion.\r\n\r\nSo yes, leave it as is.",

As long as you keep consistency in sending your ACKs, this should not be a big issue. Also note that with network paths having asymmetrical characteristics in forward or backward directions, it might be desirable from a performance viewpoint to send ACKs on some specific paths. See also #190. My main point is that we should not rely on specific scheduling from the peer to make Multipath QUIC work.\r\n\r\nRegarding your second point, I'm not against keeping the reference.

Second, I do not understand the mechanism. We understand that if a node only use heuristics, it will sometime fail to identify the old path. If it does identify it, it will send two path challenges per normal NAT rebinding guidance, only the one on the new path will succeeds, and everything will be fixed. But if it does not, it will only send a path challenge on the new path, to confirm continuity. Due to asymmetric knowledge, the peer sees only one path, so the challenge arrives on the existing path. There should be no other action than sending a path response. ",

Sorry.\r\n\r\nGeneral idea:\r\n\r\n1- loss detection will be mostly triggered by the ACK sent on the shortest return path, because with RACK most loss detection is triggered by packet number comparisons, not by timers. That means losses are detected faster if enough ACK travel on the shortest return path, which tends to improve performance quite a bit.\r\n\r\n2- ACKing packets faster leads to lower memory utilisation, as packets get out of the retransmit queue faster.\r\n\r\n3- Still, we need timer measurements to compute the PTO and deal with the loss of the \"last packet\".  Just feeding all RTT samples into the algorithms works, because the combination of `SmoothedRTT` and `RTTvar` will capture both the characteristics of the paths and whatever algorithm is implemented by the peer. The PTO formula incorporates both average and variance, and thus the PTO ends up making sense.",

I forgot that I had a separate PR for that.\r\n\r\n> First, I think the question if you should save any CIDs for NAT rebindings is independent of the multipath extension and more a general question for QUIC; yes, without multipath NAT is probably the main use case but still the sender could decide to use a new CID any time.\r\n\r\nYes, this is a general problem. In RFC 9000, we have the following statement: _An endpoint that exhausts available connection IDs cannot probe new paths or initiate migration, nor can it respond to probes or attempts by its peer to migrate. To ensure that migration is possible and packets sent on different paths cannot be correlated, endpoints SHOULD provide new connection IDs before peers migrate_ ([section 9.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-9.5-9)).\r\n\r\nMaybe we should add a reference.\r\n\r\n> Second, given you have multiple paths in use, it might be less of a problem if one path breaks because of NAT. So I can well image that there might be cases where you rather use your last CID for a new path then save it for a potentially NAT rebinding on one of the existing path.\r\n\r\nDepending on how Multipath is used, connections could become more susceptible to NAT rebindings. In QUIC v1, backup paths are expected to be established through different networks, meaning that there is low probability of multiple paths getting rebound at the same time. But in case of Multipath, one of the intended use case is to open multiple paths through the same network (so that the tunnel being built on top of QUIC serving multiple end-to-end flows can have a fair share of bandwidth against other flows). In such a use case, all paths would be affected by a single NAT device doing a rebind.\r\n\r\nThat said...\r\n\r\n> Therefor I think it is okay to mention the fact that CIDs might also be needed for NAT rebindings on existing paths but I really wouldn't use normative language here.\r\n\r\nI think I agree that we do not need a normative clause here.

In your proposal, it sounds like path identifiers are reused. This might have weird corner cases when packets are delayed. The other way to implement this is to have path identifiers increment. We need to have a consistent view of how many paths are currently in use between the two peers.\r\n\r\nThat's an important point that we need to make it clear. I think it's better to reuse than increment, as we can add some limitation for the corner cases(e.g. Path Identifier can only be reused after 3 max PTOs after the path is abandoned and all the CIDs belonging to this path is retired). It's more friendly for resource limitation of endpoints. \r\n\r\nIf we use increment, then we need to discuss when to increase the max Path Identifier in the new connection IDs without breaking the limitation for max concurrent paths.",

I think three key points need to be fixed:\r\n> \r\n> * the CID should be uniquely identified by their sequence number, not by the combination of path-id and sequence number.\r\n> * we do not need MP_RETIRE_CID\r\n> * we should never reuse path-ID, because they are part of the cryptographic nonce.\r\n\r\n@huitema I think the first 2 points are for the same design mechanism: whether the CID sequence should be allocated for per path. So basically we have 2 main issues here:\r\n\r\n* whether the CID sequence and Retire Prior to should be allocated for per path, or the whole connection use the same sequence:  For this part, my opinion is \"per path\" is better than \"the whole connection\". Because if different paths use the same sequence for CIDs, endpoints would not be able to use \"Retire Prior To\" to retire CIDs with continuous sequence. It will eventually retire CIDs from other paths and may have unexpected effects.\r\n* \"reuse\" or \"increase and no-reuse\" for path-ID:  For this part, I prefer \"increase and no-reuse\" for security consideration as Path ID are part of the cryptographic nonce. Then we will need mechanism for the limitation of max active Path IDs. Marten's design for PATH_LIMIT { highest path ID} frame might be an available way to solve this problem.",

While the current document doesn't specify a more p2p-friendly QUIC, it would be nice if our path ID design didn't unnecessarily complicate the use in the p2p context.\r\n\r\nFor the client-server case, starting connections from the server will not work well because of NAT and firewall. That does not mean that we don't want the server to only accept connections at one address. The solution is to have the server send a frame \"Call me at address IP:port\". See for example the [ADD_ADDRESS Frame in Quentin and Olivier's original draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-deconinck-quic-multipath-07#page-24). I think that a mechanism like that would work well for P2P as well, since we need something like ICE to start the P2P paths.\r\n\r\nSymmetrical path ID make path management significantly simpler in the client-server case. I believe that symmetrical path ID would also simplify the design of an ICE-like mechanism in the P2P case.\r\n\r\n",

Then there is the risk of confusion, what happens if old packets are delivered from a previous path using the path identifier.\r\n\r\nWe should make this very clear in the design. If the design goes for \"re-use\", then the node has to allocate an array of number spaces for the negotiated max number of spaces, and keep that for the duration of the connection. The effect of \"Abandon path\" becomes complicated -- if a CID for path N has never been used, should it be retired?\r\n\r\nIf the design goes for \"unique path ID\", the management of path and sequence numbers becomes simpler, but we need some logic to enforce the \"maximum number of active paths\".

Reuse the design for connection IDs: limit the number of **active** paths. The max number of active CIDs is signalled as a transport parameter (`active_connection_id_limit`) and an endpoint is allowed to issue a new CID only after the peer has retired a previous CID. Analogously, an endpoint would only issue CIDs for a new path after a previous path had been abandoned.\r\n2. Use a `MP_MAX_PATHS` frame to dynamically allow new paths (similar to a `MAX_STREAMS` frame).\r\n\r\nIn short summary, 1. has less signalling and 2. can dynamically adapt the number of concurrent paths.

It solves the second problem as @qdeconinck pointed out. The only thing is how we define the TPs which limit the number of concurrent paths.  There might be some options here. For examples:\r\n1. We use one TP to indicate the number of concurrent paths that the sender is willing to accept. For instance, if both endpoints send ''2'', there will be four concurrent paths at maximum (each endpoint can initiate two paths). \r\n2. We use two TPs where one indicates the max number of paths to be accepted by the sender and another one represents the max number of paths the sender wishes to initiate. This design allows endpoints to negotiate the total number of concurrent paths while the former one just informs the local decision to a peer.",

I would probably rename the \"Maximum paths\" field of the MAX_PATHS frame to \"Maximum Path ID\", so if a MAX_PATHS {\"Maximum Path ID\": 3} is received, it should be possible to open paths 0, 1, 2 and 3. This is mainly to limit the path IDs where MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames could be received. But if the endpoint does not send MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame for a given Path ID, the path cannot be opened by its peer anyway (no associated CID). This has also the nice property that endpoints could negotiate multipath with the `initial_max_paths` TP, initially with only one path allowed (if `initial_max_paths` is 0, as the initial path ID is 0; absence of this TP means multipath is not supported).\r\n\r\nA last point: I think we should decide whether the multipath extension leaves the door open to server-initiated paths in a latter extension. If this is the case, we should split the Path ID space in even (client-initiated) and odd (server-initiated) values, as done in e.g. stream IDs. For simplicity, the current extension could only allow client-initiated paths (so only even Path IDs).",

I am not sure defining a path as \"unidirectional forwarding path from A to B\" is a good definition because it does provide a set of criteria that uniquely distinguishes a path from the others. ",

After handshake is finished, client and server could decide by their own to create how many paths to use. Note that endpoints could always choose the Minimum value between the local strict concurrent paths and the remote strict number.\r\n4. Endpoints SHOULD issue at least one unused Path ID inside the available Path ID range, but endpoints could always choose to limit the number of Path IDs which is indeed issued inside the connection, as part of the strategy to limit the concurrent paths created by the remote.",

But I think we need to think a bit more. The purpose of the \"MAX_PATHS\" is to control the amount of resource dedicated to path managements. The resource comes in two modes:\r\n\r\n* The number of MP_CONNECTION_ID that the endpoint has to remember,\r\n* The number of path contexts that the endpoint will handle.\r\n\r\nI think that the main purpose of the MAX_PATHS is to limit the number of MP_CONNECTION_ID. The peer can only create a new path if it has received and sent an MP_CONNECTION_ID for that path. Endpoints can control the creation of paths by limiting the creation of MP_CONNECTION_ID, which is a local decision. But endpoints need to also control the number of MP_CONNECTION_ID that the peer can send -- otherwise, the peer could announce that it supports 2^31 paths, and send as many connection ID. That would blow the memory allocation.\r\n\r\nControlling a \"max number of paths\" is not sufficient. The malevolent peer could create lots of MP_CONNECTION_ID, then issue PATH_ABANDON, the create more of that. I am pretty sure that repeating that cycle many times could lead to a DOS attack. Also, we understand that \"number of paths\" is imprecise, because of transmission delays, packet loss, etc. It is simpler to have a \"MAX_PATHS\" value that state \"no path identifier larger than N\" (or 2\\*N+1). Once the number of connection ID is limited, the peers can control how much resource will be used.\r\n\r\nIf we agree on that, we also need to decide what \"MAX_SERVER_PATH=0\" means. Assume we agree that N=0 corresponds to path_ID=2\\*N+1 = 1. Does stating \"MAX_SERVER_PATH=0\" means that \"path 1 is OK\", or does it mean \"path 1 is not OK, because 1 >= 2\\*0 +1\" ?",

Modulo my suggestion to remove the trailing text, I think it is better now.\r\n\r\nOnly one point that we may need to discuss now is the meaning of MAX_SERVER_PATHS=0, but also MAX_CLIENT_PATHS=0. I think MAX_CLIENT_PATHS=0 should actually allow Path ID 0, while MAX_SERVER_PATHS=0 should also enable Path ID 1. I see two reasons for this. First, it would allow using the whole space of the identifiers, without needing to cope with an invalid 0 value -- Path ID 0 is always valid as it is the initial path of the connection. Second, MAX_CLIENT_PATHS frames only appear when multipath is negotiated.\r\n\r\nSide note related to this, I think the MAX_SERVER_PATHS should only appear when the initial_max_server_paths has been advertised by both endpoints. Otherwise, this should be a PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.",

The value in the Retire Prior To field MUST be less than or equal to the value in the Sequence Number field. Receiving a value in the Retire Prior To field that is greater than that in the Sequence Number field MUST be treated as a connection error of type FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.\r\n\r\n>Once a sender indicates a Retire Prior To value, smaller values sent in subsequent NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames have no effect. A receiver MUST ignore any Retire Prior To fields that do not increase the largest received Retire Prior To value.\r\n\r\n>An endpoint that receives a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame with a sequence number smaller than the Retire Prior To field of a previously received NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame MUST send a corresponding RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame that retires the newly received connection ID, unless it has already done so for that sequence number. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that changes is that the MP_ frames are used und that the sequence numbers are per path. This is explained in the text. What else do you think needs to be specified?",

Further, if you can also release the CID that you got from your peer for this path ID, even if you didn't receive a retire CID frame from your peer, as you will anyway not use them anymore.

As the semantic of active_connection_id_limit has been changed (for per path), the limit is also needed to be declared(at least 'follow the limit of RFC9000').\r\n\r\nThe scene of migration could happen like this (e.g. set active_connection_id_limit = 2) :\r\n0. Client A and Server B have a connection negotiated active_connection_id_limit = 2, both endpoints issued 2 available CIDs for each path;\r\n1. Client A create a new path with Server B, Server B choose to use DCID(path_id = P1, CID_seq = C1) for peer address(IP1, Port 1);\r\n2. Client A is inside a NAT environment, after some time, the NAT port changed to(IP1, Port 2). While Server B find Client A is still using Path_id = P1, it consider the situation as NAT rebinding trigger the path migration, then it start to use DCID(path_id = P1, CID_seq = C2) for peer address(IP1, Port 2); \r\n3. When Client find out Server start to use DCID(path_id = P1, CID_seq = C2), it sends MP_NEW_CID(path_id = P1, CID_seq = C3, Retire Prio To = C2) containing the new CID. But this frame never touch the peer and waits to be retransmitted.  \r\n4. When the NAT Port changes again at client side, the server have no unused available CID for the new address, it could still wait for the retransmission of MP_NEW_CID, and hold the path without any error.\r\n",

When endpoint is waiting for the new CID to be retransmitted, there's a short period that no available CID can be used.\r\n- Scene 2: Endpoints have used all the CIDs limited by _ active_connection_id_limit_ , and fail to retire the oldest CID. That could happen when the MP_RETIRE_CID is lost and waiting for retransmission. There's also a period that endpoints might not have available CID for the path.

There are two cases here actually:\r\n\r\nThe first case is when the an endpoint sends an abandon frame first. At this point of time, that endpoint does not know if there are any packets in flight from the other end. If so, I think, those packets should not get lost during a graceful path close. Therefore I think we should recommend to wait for the abandon frame from the peer (or max 3 PTOs?) before removing the CIDs used by the peer. Also note that the packet with path abandon could get lost and until this lost is detected and retransmitted, the other end might keep sending data.\r\n\r\nThe other case is when an endpoint receives a path abandon frame and all previous packets on the path have been received or declared lost, it can retire the CIDs for both sides immediately. If there is a gap in the packet number, packets were not sent or reordered. In this case we can say the peer may wait 3 PTOs (?) before it retires the CIDs used by the peer. But I think this is really optional as reordering is usually not that likely and those few packets can be retransmitted over another paths.\r\n\r\nWe can of course alternatively also say that all data after the path abandon was sent is lost and need to be retransmitted on another path. In this case an endpoint also would make all packets with outstanding ACKs that were sent on that path as lost and could immediately release all path ressources including the path ID. The only issue might be that if the path abandon got list it would also not be retransmitted but the other end would eventually close the path anyway. That would theoretically work but might be a bit of a waste of network ressources...",

Yes, you can't send before the path is validated, or at least not more the amplification limit. But I guess that's the intention. I guess the only thing we can mention is that if you delay longer than the time-out, the other end will assume validation failed and close the path.

An endpoint receives a path validation but it can't  reply to it because it doesn't have a CID for that path ID. In this case there are two option: either immediately send the path_abandon (and the other end could try again with a different path ID), or wait for a while to see if a CID for that path ID arrives.

There are two parts:\r\n\r\n* sending a PATH_RESPONSE or not. \r\n* sending PATH_ABANDON.\r\n\r\nWe had a discussion in the WG, and there is some plausible variation on either statement.\r\n\r\nFirst, I think that the way to not accept a path is indeed to not send a path response. We agree on that, but RFC 9000 section 8.2.2 says: _On receiving a PATH_CHALLENGE frame, an endpoint MUST respond by echoing the data contained in the PATH_CHALLENGE frame in a PATH_RESPONSE frame. An endpoint MUST NOT delay transmission of a packet containing a PATH_RESPONSE frame unless constrained by congestion control._ That means we make a reference to the 8.2.2, and specify that if the receiver does not want to accept the path, it must not send the PATH_RESPONSE. (Of course, an endpoint could also send a PATH_RESPONSE and then send a PATH_ABANDON later -- there is not rule against that.)\r\n\r\nSecond, we had a discussion of whether the PATH_ABANDON shall be sent immediately. I think it depends on the reason why the endpoint cannot accept the new path. It may be a definitive reason, but it may also be a temporary reason, such as \"I have not received a PATH NEW CID for that PATH yet.\" In the temporary case, it makes sense to not send the PATH_ABANDON immediately, just wait until the client repeats the PATH_CHALLENGE and acknowledge it then.\r\n\r\nIf for whatever reason the denying endpoint does not send the PATH_ABANDON immediately, the peer will trying repeating the challenge, and eventually will give up and PATH_ABANDON. At that point, the endpoint MUST send its own PATH_ABANDON.\r\n\r\nOur own challenge is to convey all that in a couple of short paragraphs.",

              "body": "@mirjak the conversations are marked as \"resolved\", so it is hard for @qdeconinck and others to get the arguments. (This is a side effect of carrying discussions in PR instead of in a specialized issue.)\r\n\r\n@qdeconinck I think the text is fine, but we have two items of disagreement.\r\n\r\n1. Should we use normative language (e.g., should -> SHOULD) in this specific section? \r\n\r\n2. If we do use normative language, should we say SHOULD or MUST?\r\n\r\nThe argument against normative language that we are going to make a reference to {{close}}, which itself contains normative language, so we should not duplicate it. I do not think this is a strong argument, because the paragraph just before this says _\"When the multipath extension is negotiated, a client that wants to use an\r\nadditional path MUST first initiate the Address Validation procedure\r\nwith PATH_CHALLENGE and PATH_RESPONSE frames as described in\r\n{{Section 8.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}...\"_ We also know from experience that using lower case \"should\" tends to confuse the readers, who will wonder whether this is a hard requirement or not.\r\n\r\nThe argument for MUST is the classic issue: if you say \"SHOULD\" instead of \"MUST\", in which cases shall the implementation not follow your advice? If you cannot spell out a case, just say MUST. In this case, there are plausible arguments for waiting a bit in some cases, e.g., waiting until an appropriate CID becomes available. That CID may well be just following the PATH_CHALLENGE in the same packet, or it may be arriving on another path. My original proposal had text to that effect, but we split it out.\r\n\r\nSo, my preference would be for SHOULD (upper case), and some additional text explaining the alternative. I think the additional text should be as \"matter of fact\" as possible. Something like: \"The endpoint MAY delay sending a PATH_RESPONSE or a PATH_ABANDON, knowing that if neither or those is sent in a reasonable time the peer will eventually close the path as specified in section {{close}}.\"",

              "body": "Just on your first point: I don't understand your argument. This section has normative language; that's fine because it's the normative language on what you need to do when you open a path. However, the normative language on closing a path should be in the section on path closure. Also what I wanted to say is that the normative requirement is already there in that section on path closure and broad enough that is already covers this case (\"An endpoint that wants to close a path MUST explicitly terminate the path by sending a PATH_ABANDON frame.\"). It's not only about saying the same things twice normatively in the document in different places (which I think is also bad) but also to make clear that this case here is actually not special. It's always the same: if you want to close a path you have to send a PATH_ABANDON no matter what.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the point you are trying to make about the sentence here is actually slightly different because it says \"should immediately close\". So the question with the word \"immediately\" in there is: do we want to give any (normative) recommendation when exactly to close the path? First, we can't really enforce that an endpoint sends anything immediately or not anyway. However, I also don't understand your point above why there should be any benefit in waiting...? If you don't send the PATH_RESPONSE immediately because you are hoping to get more ressources, then you actually don't want to close the path (and respectively should not send an PATH_ABANDON). However, if you have decided that you don't want to establish the path (and that's what the sentence says), I don't see any reason to delay the sending of a PATH_ABANDON.\r\n\r\nIn summary I don't see a reason to delay the PATH_ABANDON and I don't think we should talk about the timing at all. So I still don't think we should use normative language here. However, I agree that lower case \"should\"s are confusing and we could consider using a different phrasing that avoids that!\r\n\r\n",

So the sender should actually skip one. But even if you assume you missed one, I don't think that information is really helpful as you don't know what would be in there or when it will arrive, so you have to make a sending decision based on the information you have right now.",

That's a specific manifestation of the more general problem that we don't really know what processes drive the creation and teardown of paths.

Stacks could read what alternate IP addresses are available and just try them all, but the failure modes are easy to imagine. Plus, applications will want to specify the scheduling of packet on paths, for example setting affinity between stream and paths.\r\n\r\nThe problem with rules like \"lowest number first\" is that the two endpoints need to agree on the rule. In our current draft, paths are always created by the client. That does not mean that servers should never abandon paths, but they should do that mostly if the path appears broken. In the duplicate example, the two paths are both valid, so there is no obvious criteria. Letting the client chose seems the simplest solution.",

If the client don't want to have the new path, it would not have opened it. however, it make open the new path and then plan to close the old one for some reason. On the other hand, if the old one is in active use and the new one not yet, that it's maybe not optional to close the old.

There we said it is a requirement to validate a new path before you can use it. How you do that (sending path challenge, padding and amplification limits) is not specific to the multipath extension and already specified sufficiently in RFC9000.\r\n\r\nPart of the discuss was that people want to still have a MUST in this draft to be explicit on the requirement that you have to validate the path before use (also for a new path and not only migration) but we should specify less of the details. That means we have to revise this sentence in any case. I guess we could maybe still also note somehow that RFC9000 considers padding to ensure that the new paths can support size requirement and there is an limit to avoid amplification attacks but it should really more being phrased as providing pointers than actual requirements.",

The anti-amplification limit might be moot if you're not allowed to send real data (\"use the path\") until it's validated, but I don't see that in RFC 9000. Regular QUIC says that clients \"MAY probe for peer reachability ... prior to migrating\" and \"an endpoint MAY send data to an unvalidated peer address\" after a potential migration, which suggests that any requirement to complete validation before \"use\" is new in this document.\r\n\r\nWe've eliminated the probing/non-probing distinction, and a requirement to complete validation before using the path seems like a return to that distinction.\r\n\r\nRegardless, my intention with these sections was to provide pointers and clarify requirements that do still apply.",

If you can't validate the address because of the amplification limit, you simply can't sent on that path (or in case of RFC9000 you can't migrate to this path). In this case you can create the path and hope to receive more data such that you can sooner or later send the path challenge, or you might want to close the path by sending a path abandon frame on another path. If you don't want to close the path immediately but wait for more data, I guess it makes sense to start a timer. However, I don't think we need to specify anything here but can leave this to the implementation. Again, it's the same for RFC900 where you receive a packet that creates some migration state that you eventually want to remove at some point again.",

I think this is really the same as the requirement on IP address validation, where each endpoint need to do it independently but can and should enforce it for the other end. So something like this:\r\n\r\n`Each endpoint MUST also validate that a minimum MTU of 1200 bytes is supported on the path. This can be done during initial path validation or separately later if the amplification limit prevents it initially, as specified in Section 8.2.1 of RFC9000.`",

Thinking more about this, I think using the QUIC error code space is wrong. I think we should not call this error code at all. In case of connection close, you actually close the connection because there was an unexpected protocol behavior. In case of the multipath extension, it is the same: if there is something unexpected, you have to close the whole connection. Therefore closing a path is never an error but always an explicit decision. ",

I don't think any of those cause any real problems for the recipient, as Mirja put it, it's mainly for debugging. And someone investigating these should always be skeptical of the peer not telling the ground truth.\r\n\r\nOn balance, I think its fine to use the QUIC error code space here.

Of course you want to have a limit to avoid excessive resource usage because that would open an attack, however, under normal operation you should not be blocked. In case of the number of paths, there can be other reasons to limit, e.g. you may have a policy to not use more than a small number of paths. Therefore I argue that MAY would make more sense here than SHOULD. However, I don't have a really strong opinion. I would like to hear other people's thoughts.",

And then we have the next issue: making the document so large that implementers shudder at the idea of reading it all. \r\n\r\nAlso, let me reiterate that we have very little operational experience. We can make recommendations, but they are based on that limited experience. When there are lots of possible valid strategies, it might be better to say nothing.",

I guess you could even always transmit the first PATH_ABANDON on a path that you know is working for sure but I guess that's something we didn't really experiment with yet. So I think this specific case is really more than a random recommendation.\r\n\r\nSecond, you mention that the draft gets too long. a) these are really the final edits here, so I actually think it a bit too late to worry about this now. However, more importantly b) we need to do another editorial path. I think there are a bunch of things in the intro part that we can remove or move to the appendix. Maybe there are also a few things from the \"normative\" part (section 2, 3, 4) that we can move into the implementation guidance. However that part is only 10 pages and I don't think overly lengthly. Again an editorial pass might still help to tighten the language up more but that's on my todo list for after this draft revision.",

That's because most of the issues about releasing state too soon are already discussed in the draft, in particular is [3.3.1. ](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#section-3.3.1)[Avoiding Spurious Stateless Resets](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#name-avoiding-spurious-stateless).\r\n\r\nThe \"spurious stateless reset\" issue is the main reason to be cautious with unilateral removal of state. Dropping packets is kind of bad, but will not crash the connection. Dropping the CID sent to the peer before receiving the PATH_ABANDON from the peer is worse, because of the risk of generating a spurious stateless reset and thus killing the connection. \r\n\r\nSo maybe we should say:\r\n```\r\nIt is left to the implementation to handle this unexpected\r\nbehavior. Implementation MAY shed some of the path state and reduce\r\nresource consumption if the PATH_ABANDON is\r\nnot arriving in a reasonable time, but they SHOULD\r\ntake steps and avoid sending spurious stateless reset (see {{spurious-stateless-reset}}).\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

However, I don't think it addresses the issue. If you send a path_abandon frame you immediately retire all CIDs that you received from the other end which means you can't not sent on the path anymore. That avoids connection closure of spurious reset, as also mentioned in the paragraph just before his new proposed text, and it exactly what path_abandon stand for - it a clear promise that you won't sent on the path anymore.\r\n\r\nThe problem we are trying to address is about retiring the CIDs that you provided to the peer. Because those you are expected to only retire when you receive a path_abandon from the other end. And here I think we should be clear that there is also a recommend minimal time of 3 PTO before retiring the CID that were issues to the other end. But I think we could be more concrete in the proposed text and not talk about \"path state\" but more specifically about \"issued CIDs\". Would that help (see proposed commit)?",

I have sent the ABANDON already, the peer should not be using the path, if it keeps doing so, too bad. There is never a guarantee that a packet will be received, and there is no protocol violation if the packets that were dropped are not acked.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich points that [see next comment]",

It may do a number of things:\r\n\r\n1) It may decide to drop any incoming packet on that path. That has no interoperability impact, as long as those dropped packets are never acknowledged. Indeed, that's exactly what would happen if the path had become bad and packets were dropped in the network. But it has some performance impact, since some packets will be in transit when the Path Abandon is sent. It is recommended to not do that earlier than 3 PTOs after sending the PATH_ABANDON frame.\r\n\r\n2) It may decide to consider all packets send on that path as lost, and resend the frames through another path. That's fine. It might cause some duplicate transmission, but that also happens for other reasons (e.g., bad timers) and has no interoperability impact. The rules there are murky, because this is a tradeoff -- resend sooner minimizes the end-to-end latency caused by losses, but resend sooner also increases the risk of duplicate transmission, which reduces efficiency. The 3PTO rule is probably one end of the tradeoff: good mitigation of duplicate transmission, poor management of latency. A 1PTO rule would be a different tradeoff, more focused on managing latency.\r\n\r\n3) It should send the \"missing ACKs\" on another path before clearing the missing ACK state. Again, that's an efficiency tradeoff. If the node does not send acknowledgements, it risks causing spurious retransmission. \r\n\r\n4) It may well decide to never increase the MAX_PATH_ID until the PATH_ABANDON has been received.

Packets that were received from the peer and processed but not yet acked,\r\n> 3. the total number of paths considered active, which some implementation use to decide when to increase the Max Path ID.\r\n\r\nPacket handling as mentioned in point 1 and 2 seems actually partly orthogonal here. If you have send the path abandon frame, you should probably not have any outstanding packets that need to be acked on that path. However, you should also never just forgot about outstanting/non-acked packets. If you decide to remove state about non-ack packets, you need to declare them lost and resent on another path. I guess if you really want to sent a path abandon frame even though you have outstanding packets, you should probably declare them lost and resent on another path right away.\r\n\r\nAbout your point 2, I don't think there is an issue here and I'm not sure when this case could/would happen. If you have received packets, I guess you should first send the ACK and then the path abandon. Of course you can also send ACKs on other paths still.\r\n\r\nThe important part is about packet handling of new incoming packets and you should be able to process those for at least 3 PTOs after sending the path abandon frame. This means, you need to remember the path ID and corresponding CID(s) as well as the packet number space state. However, as soon as you remove the CID(s), you cannot process any new incoming packets anymore and as such you can then also remove all packet number space state as well for received packets. For out-going packets, it's really on you if you remove state even though there are ACKs missing; however, as I said above that means you have to retransmit on another paths.\r\n\r\nThe interesting case is actually your point 3. If you remove path state that means you remove the path ID and will consider it as not active anymore. As such you could send a new max path ID. However, as the other end is not sending you a path abandon frame it will consider the path ID as active and not increase its max path ID. Respectively, you might not be able to open a new path. But I guess that's what we have the path blocked frame for. So I guess there is no problem either way.\r\n\r\nSo should we maybe say this to be more clear:\r\n\r\n> However, an endpoint SHOULD process incoming packets for the abandoned Path ID and corresponding connection IDs for at least 3 PTOs after sending the PATh_ABANDON frame.",

Implementation may trigger that ACK by bundling a Ping with their ACK, but they cannot do that too frequently -- typically no more than once every N ACK, with N at least 2, and no more than once per RTT. So you get very scarce feedback, and any estimation of capacity based on that is imprecise. Plus, in the general case, the ACK traffic is way lower than link capacity, so you don't get an accurate estimate of capacity -- this is an app-limited scenario. ",

However, given we discuss in this text in the implementation guidance explicitly that ACKs could be send on another path, with is different than in the single path case, I think it is fair to add an additional warning about congestion control and point to the respective text in RFC9002 that already takes about ACK congestion control. Therefore I propose to merge this PR incl. the proposed commit with the reference to RFC9002; I believe the discussed showed there is agreement to merge.",

But if I have that flag, the number of CID in the frame is just informational. The value is mostly to be nice with the receiver, as in \"if the number expected is lower than what you have sent, don't bother.\" Kinda nice to have.",

It helps a bit -- no point repeating if the peer has already sent more CIDs. Endpoints still need to track acknowledgements if they want to avoid spurious retransmissions -- but then, that's true of every frame, so there may not be much need to say that again.",

That section is a bit weird, because it is unclear whether it applies to the initiator of the migration or to the peer. If we want to prevent guidance, we could say:\r\n\r\nFor any given path, we may expect to observe the Connection ID rotation, NAT Rebinding and Migration\r\nas specified by RFC 9000, although happening in a single path. These events do not change the path ID,\r\nand do not affect the packet number space associated with the path. As a general rule, implementations\r\nshould strongly prefer using multipath mechanisms such as creating a new path to the path migration\r\nmechanisms of RFC 9000. This enables a smoother handover and allows a simplified migration\r\nhandling at the server side as NAT rebindings imply immediate loss of the old\r\naddress. However, if the server requests migration to a \"preferred address\", clients must initiate an\r\nRFC9000-style migration of path 0 to that preferred address.\r\n\r\nRotating the connection ID on a path does not change the Path ID\r\nnor the packet number space.\r\n\r\nWhile endpoints assign a connection ID to a specific sending 4-tuple,\r\nnetworks events such as NAT rebinding may make the packet's receiver\r\nobserve a different 4-tuple. Though it changes the 4-tuple of the path,\r\nthe connection ID remains the same, and so the related path identifier.\r\n\r\nServers observing a 4-tuple change will\r\nperform path validation (see {{Section 9 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}).\r\nIf path validation process succeeds, the endpoints set\r\nthe path's congestion controller and round-trip time\r\nestimator according to {{Section 9.4 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.\r\n\r\n",

As I mentioned in IETF 122, we designed a multiplexed transport and shipped it as PS without any mechanism to signal prioritization or to schedule data across streams. The only guidance was in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-2.3\r\n\r\n> Stream multiplexing can have a significant effect on application performance if resources allocated to streams are correctly prioritized.\r\n\r\n> QUIC does not provide a mechanism for exchanging prioritization information. Instead, it relies on receiving priority information from the application.\r\n\r\n> A QUIC implementation SHOULD provide ways in which an application can indicate the relative priority of streams. An implementation uses information provided by the application to determine how to allocate resources to active streams.\r\n\r\nHence, I don't think we should be holding this extension to some higher bar of expectation.\r\n",

If I have dramatically misunderstood this document, and it's just a souped-up failover, then I withdraw my comments.\r\n\r\nAs always, \"Multipath\" is an almost useless term, as it conflates failover mechanisms (which we have been doing in proposed standards for 25 years) and concurrent delivery of application data over multiple paths, which can work well in some cases but doesn't have a general theory that accounts for different application flows and path properties.\r\n\r\nAs for the comparison to opening multiple connections, I have several responses:\r\n1) Procedurally, we just ran 9743 through the consensus process and no one said a peep about the concurrent multipath text.\r\n\r\n2) I would not say that opening multiple connections is exactly encouraged, although defects in TCP and HTTP<3 have incentivized this behavior. But we are not the protocol police; it is common behavior.\r\n\r\n3) Opening multiple connections tends to, IIUC, stripe separate operations along different connections. In the general case, doing something like striping a very large file over multiple connections would be quite difficult.\r\n\r\n4) When the paths have different properties, it is not at all clear what to do in terms of scheduling.",

I do not think that RFC 9473 applies to scheduling algorithms. Scheduling algorithms define which packets goes on what path, and there are very many algorithms that could be tried, such as:\r\n\r\n* associate QUIC streams to specific paths, so as to minimize the amount of reordering between packets received on the same path (some folks do that with picoquic)\r\n* or, spread packets of a long stream on multiple paths, based on whichever path has congestion control credits available at time of scheduling (picoquic does that by default)\r\n* or, send a stream twice, with one copy on each path, to get the best delivery delay,\r\n* or, use some kind of FEC, send a stream on one path and redundant FEC packets on the other, to get the best delays without being too piggish.\r\n\r\nAll of those have been experimented. All depends on following whatever limits are imposed by per path congestion control.",

Simultaneous path usage generally, however, needs more consideration than specified in this document to avoid negative performance impacts, e.g. when stream data is distributed over multiple paths with different delays.[\u00b6](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#section-1-9)\"\r\n\r\nI assume the intention is to introduce the term \"concurrent multipath\", however, I don't think this is necessary because we should rather use the term that is already introduced in this document, which is \"simultaneous path usage\".",

This could be done either internally, or by letting applications \"pin\" a stream to a path.\r\n* or, spreading stream data frames across several paths, to obtain load balancing.\r\n\r\nWe could see similar consideration for datagram frames.

I was almost ready to commit the suggestion, but will let @mirjak do that once consensus is assessed.\r\n\r\nI did read RFC7829, and I don't think citing it would be useful. The multipath extension does not create a new path fail-over capability, because that capability is already defined in RFC 9000. For example, the concern about simultaneous failover creating a thundering herd issue applies equally with and without the multipath extensions to RFC 9000. ",

I think that is more clear and otherwise the question comes up why is it out of scope. I think it's reflecting more how we decided to focus the document and leave other things for future work. Why do you think that the \"out-of-scope\" re-wording is needed/different/better?\r\n- Are there existing IETF specification of path fail-over? Which? if so we should add a reference somewhere (not necessarily here but maybe in the scheduling section) but not sure what you mean.\r\n- I don't think we need to say \"simultaneously using the capacity of a set of\" that is just more words and still says the same thing as \"simultaneously using multiple paths\".\r\n- Actually I don't really understand why it is important to mention \"standards-track\" here?\r\n- Saying \"simultaneous concurrent\" is saying the same thing twice. I don't see a different here. We keep using \"simultaneous\" in this document, so I think we should stick with it. We could change that but I don't see a difference.",

The assertion here is that although methods like RFC6356 are EXP, this extension is STD. This spec can be used with either.\r\n\r\n I'd say we must mention this keyword: concurrent. It is used in the literature - and concurrent multipath was a topic long before QUIC was on the seem, it has also been used in other IETF work. I don't mind if you define simultaneous in this spec. (that's your choice). I do think it should explain that concurrent usage is within scope.

However, I\u2019m not sure RFC7829 is really relevant here because I don\u2019t think it necessarily assumes that packet are transmitted on more than one path at any point of time. It\u2019s more you want to detect a breakage quickly and stop sending on one path and then start sending on another path. So in other words no concurrent use. However, I only had a quick look.\r\n\r\nOn the term concurrent multipath: MP-TCP uses \u201csimultaneous\". There is not a single occurrence of \u201cconcurrent\u201d in that RFC8684. So why is this a requirement for this document now? Also we now refer to RFC9743 which explains and uses that term but given scheduling is not part of this document, I don\u2019t see why we need to use it. I think \u201csimultaneous\u201d is equally clear. \r\n\r\nHowever, here is a proposal to add this to my proposed sentence above:\r\n```suggestion\r\nFurther, this document does not specify scheduling algorithms that define\r\nhow multiple, simultaneously open paths are used to send packets.\r\nAs these differ depending on application requirements,\r\nonly some basic implementation guidance is discussed in {{impl-consideration}}.\r\nThis extension can be used with different scheduling algorithms,\r\ne.g., for failover or capacity aggregation, even though\r\nthere is no IETF document that specifies scheduling algorithms\r\nfor simultaneous path usage, sometime also referred to as concurrent multipath, at this point of time.\r\n```\r\n\r\n@Gorry please let me know if that proposed text/sentence would be okay for you instead of your text?\r\n\r\nHowever, I would also like to get more input from others before merging! @LPardue @huitema @qdeconinck @Yanmei-Liu ",

          "body": "To repeat my previous comment: per RFC 9002, the measurement of delays is only used to decide to send a PTO. Packets are only considered lost when there is a hole in the ACK sequence. The PTO packet will trigger an ACK and thus provide an opportunity to detect this hole. Sending a PTO is not supposed to have an impact besides triggering the ACK -- in particular, it should not impact congestion control. Getting the delays wrong means sending a PTO too early, which causes a fairly minimal overhead, or sending a PTO too late, which delays loss recovery. Given these two risks, I would rather err on the side of \"too early\". That's a good reason to not make suggestions about \"using the largest delay\" -- that would be akin to jumping in the pond to avoid the rain.",

Accepting samples as they go works OK for RFC9002-style algorithm that maintain a running evaluation of smoothed RTT and variations. If the sender changes tactic and ack paths, there will be a period of adaptation, and then the algorithm will converge.\r\n\r\nThe main issue that I found in practice is the maintenance of min RTT. RFC 9002 algorithms do not rely on it, but other algorithms like BBR or LEDBAT do. If the sender switches from a low latency ack path to a higher latency path, these algorithms will keep using the old min RTT for a long time, and performance will suffer. The fix here is to reevaluate min RTT if the ACK path changes, but that requires finding out that the path did change. A plausible solution is to monitor the last min RTT ack path ID, and reevaluate min RTT if no new ACK is received on that path for some time -- maybe 3RTT.",

I wondered whether we should say that there is no need to send keep-alives on more than one path, but we don't have enough experience to make such recommendations.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to say here. I guess if you don't send on any path and want to keep the connection open, you have to send keep-alives on at least one path. Probably the last one that you were actively using is the most likely one where the keep-alives will actually make it though. But I guess it really depends on the use case; if it is really important for you to keep the connection open, maybe sending on all (when no path is actively used) is the right thing to do...?",

The probing concept still exists in the context of RFC9000 migration; this means if you receive a packet with a new 4-tuple using an active path ID.\r\n\r\nI don't understand how the probing concept is still needed for this.  An RFC9000 migration is only allowed for involuntary migrations I think, because \"To open a new path, an endpoint MUST use a new connection ID associated with an unused path ID\".  So voluntary RFC9000-style migrations are disallowed.  And as this section (3.1.2) clearly states that probing or non-probing packets do not affect the path status when an RFC9000 migration happens.  So whether the RFC9000-style migration did happen with a probing packet or not does not make any difference.",

While with RFC9000 migration, you might sending only probing packets first and validate the path and then only when the client decided to send the first non-probing packet on that path, the server also need to switch over and start using the new and can't not use the old path anymore which then is implicitly closed.",
